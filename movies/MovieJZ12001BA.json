[{"T":"301","3":"Stepping back into the Smith Estate, Chrome feels an odd sense of nostalgia."},{"T":"301","3":"He has never returned home with this sensation in the past. Since becoming a Construct, his home has been the lounge he shares with Strike Hawk. His communications with John have mostly been done through his comms."},{"T":"301","3":"The furniture in the estate looks identical to how it was when he left. Even the vases and framed paintings have not moved an inch."},{"T":"301","3":"It is as if his home and the person living in it have frozen in time together, in a fittingly cold, indifferent house."},{"T":"301","2":"Service Bot R2","3":"Facial scans completed\u2014confirming identity\u2014identity confirmed: Construct, Chrome."},{"T":"301","2":"Service Bot R2","3":"Welcome back."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Right.

Thank you."},{"T":"301","3":"He smiles at the robot, and before he leaves for the study, he lays his hand on top of its dome-shaped head, gently giving it a pat."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Mr. Smith."},{"T":"301","2":"John","3":"I've heard about the specialized frame from Nikola."},{"T":"301","2":"John","3":"The risk it poses is still too difficult to gauge, and it comes with complicated baggage.

That is the life he knows now."},{"T":"301","3":"Instead, he is wearing a suit that does not match his station, standing in an indulgent hotel ballroom coated in gold, holding a glass of wine someone handed him\u2014he is a Construct.
