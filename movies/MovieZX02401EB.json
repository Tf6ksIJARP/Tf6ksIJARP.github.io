It is as if she has mustered her last bit of strength. The sound of her pipe is weak and fading, but she is not giving up."},{"T":"301","3":"There is no resentment or hatred in her iris-colored eyes. They are as clear as the lake water in autumn, yet they express so many indescribable feelings."},{"T":"301","3":"The dragon and the girl share the same life."},{"T":"301","3":"The evil dragon must be slain."},{"T":"301","3":"The girl knows that more than anyone else."},{"T":"301","3":"Every second she hesitates, more people will die."},{"T":"301","3":"When your eyes meet, you both understand what has to be done."},{"T":"301","3":"The pointy end of that pipe is thrust deeply into the flesh."},{"T":"301","3":"The pain suffocates her. The sorrowful sound of pipe clearly shows how she is having trouble breathing."},{"T":"301","3":"The champion must fulfill the destiny."},{"T":"301","3":"The girl looks up slightly as she bathes in the sunlight. Her sight penetrates the cold stone walls and the ravaged wastelands to a beautiful place."},{"T":"301","3":"It is as if she has forgotten all her suffering. There is a faint smile on her face."},{"T":"301","3":"The music is coming to an end as the girl puts the pipe against her chest and closes her eyes peacefully."},{"T":"301","3":"The crimson eyes of that evil dragon dull as it lies flat on the floor and stops breathing."},{"T":"301","3":"You are overwhelmed by a sense of despair and depression."},{"T":"301","3":"The world quickly rewinds as you regain all your senses in the real world. Countless memories fill your mind."},{"T":"301","3":"It feels like a late prophecy. Like the judgment of a prophet."},{"T":"301","3":"The girl writes a story to seal her own fate. What a dramatic coincidence."},{"T":"301","3":"She has written down every torment she can possibly imagine in such detail. All the sorrowful feelings are hidden in the chest, waiting for the cruel reality to reveal them one by one."},{"T":"301","3":"What a tragic yet somewhat comedic story this is."},{"T":"301","3":"Arrogance."},{"T":"301","3":"The blinding flashes, the exquisite artificial flowers, the crowded place, the thundering applause, the warming smiles, and the talking mouths..."},{"T":"301","3":"This isn't polite, whether you are staring someone in their face or spacing out in an interview."},{"T":"301","3":"Congratulations.

What inspired you to write an ending like that?"},{"T":"301","2":"Journalist","3":"...The ending is just brilliant."},{"T":"301","3":"Your work is hollow and empty."},{"T":"301","2":"Journalist","3":"...How about we change to a more casual subject? What do you do when you can't seem to find more inspiration?"},{"T":"301","3":"How will she answer these questions?"},{"T":"301","3":"The blinding light shines as the camera catches every subtle movement in milliseconds. Nothing escapes its iris, whether it's the fingers, the lips, or any other part of the body."},{"T":"301","3":"She thought there would be nothing she could have hidden."},{"T":"301","3":"Selena opens her mouth but utters no sound.

Some words are typed and then removed."},{"T":"301","3":"Countless fantasies echo in her mind as if ghosts from the past have come back to haunt her, screaming they want to be made real."},{"T":"301","3":"Her fingertips are burning. The words she was once proud of are now a mess. The elegance in her sentences is gone. She cannot piece together any meaningful phrases."},{"T":"301","3":"This has never been easy. And she can never stop writing. The ending of a show isn't really an end. She has to keep on writing, restless and scared."},{"T":"301","3":"Even if she thinks she is out of ideas and even if she is actually out of ideas, she has to press on."},{"T":"301","3":"Her pen describes arrogance, childishness, innocence, lies, and baseless speculations.

In the Technology Department of  the Control Court, Babylonia."},{"T":"301","3":"The holographic screen flashes and blinks every millisecond as people operate several terminals, focusing on their tasks at hand. Sometimes, these people will gather around and have a brief talk before they go back to their own businesses. Then, with a beep, the door of this room opens."},{"T":"301","3":"The human in a uniform stands up to greet the visitors and operate their terminals to check the lists."},{"T":"301","3":"When she sees the item being transported this time, she can't help but take a step back."},{"T":"301","3":"She can make out what seems to be a humanoid statue hidden beneath the large canvas. It is so huge that it almost blocks the hallway."},{"T":"301","2":"Sullie","3":"What is this? Why do we have to inspect and check the entity technologies of a WGAA device?"},{"T":"301","3":"This isn't really a question as the speaker isn't expecting an answer but just complaining. Every item from the Babylonia administrative department is approved and uploaded to the associated terminal with documents."},{"T":"301","3":"Sullie enters a command into the system but realizes the document doesn't allow her access to read it."},{"T":"301","3":"With her eyebrows furrowed, she looks up and is surprised to see a hand placed on the canvas."},{"T":"301","3":"Another pink-haired female Construct dressed in the same uniform turns and nods at her colleague."},{"T":"301","2":"Sullie","3":"Ishmael, you scared me."},{"T":"301","2":"Ishmael","3":"Sorry. I didn't see you."},{"T":"301","3":"When there is something this big blocking the hallway, there is no way you can miss it."},{"T":"301","3":"Sullie doesn't want to talk about this any further, so she just waves her hand, telling the other girl to drop this subject."},{"T":"301","2":"Sullie","3":"So, you are back from the surface, huh? Did you find anything?"},{"T":"301","2":"Sullie","3":"I heard this is an emergency. What's the situation? All the missions are highly classified. I haven't heard any news."},{"T":"301","2":"??","3":"Everything involving the Task Force is an emergency."},{"T":"301","3":"The voice of a woman comes from the room."},{"T":"301","3":"Ishmael's arrival livens up the air in this room."},{"T":"301","2":"Ishmael","3":"Things are different this time."},{"T":"301","3":"Ishmael's tone is monotonous. It seems she doesn't want to share anything more about this mission, so she quickly changes to another subject."},{"T":"301","3":"She reaches out with one hand and opens it."},{"T":"301","3":"There is a purple flower in her palm."},{"T":"301","2":"Ishmael","3":"I found this on the surface this time."},{"T":"301","2":"Ishmael","3":"It is a purple iris."},{"T":"301","3":"The blade-like leaves expand outward as the dreamy, fragile purple petals curl, forming a layered, elegant shape. Its beauty is far beyond that of anything artificial."},{"T":"301","3":"The flower is almost floating above Ishmael's palm. The shimmering light proves this is not real."},{"T":"301","3":"This is a flower made of data."},{"T":"301","2":"Sullie","3":"You seem like you are enjoying yourself."},{"T":"301","3":"Upon taking a closer look, Sullie realizes this is indeed just an ordinarily beautiful flower made of data. She is not interested anymore."},{"T":"301","3":"Everyone who comes back from the surface has to go through multiple tedious checking and disinfection processes. The same goes for every object brought back from the surface, even if it's just a flower or a rock."},{"T":"301","3":"And Ishmael is especially fond of collecting those things."},{"T":"301","3":"She seems interested in every little thing she finds on the surface."},{"T":"301","3":"And the restricting rules push Ishmael to start using her power."},{"T":"301","3":"Ishmael has the ability to rebuild anything in detail using only data. There is no solid evidence, but Sullie is certain Ishmael is one of the best Babylonia Constructs when it comes to calculating."},{"T":"301","3":"It is almost magic instead of calculation."},{"T":"301","3":"An item created by Ishmael is actually even more exquisite and 'realistic' than the real item."},{"T":"301","3":"She is almost like Rabbi, the legend of the Golden Age who could infuse souls into clays using sorcery."},{"T":"301","3":"But unfortunately, she seems to be interested in only strange little things."},{"T":"301","3":"Take the iris flower this time for example, or the gray marionette she brought back last time..."},{"T":"301","3":"She has a taste for retro stuff."},{"T":"301","3":"Sullie looks at Ishmael's seat and sees light spots floating above the desk. She gets closer and feels as if she has entered a display case of the Golden Age filled with various strange toys."},{"T":"301","3":"She focuses back on reality as her mind slowly drifts away and looks at Ishmael, who is talking to the others in the room and slightly turns her head as if she has sensed Sullie's attention."},{"T":"301","3":"Her white pupils are like a void filled with magic power. She smiles as if she wants to know whether Sullie wants anything."},{"T":"301","2":"Sullie","3":"Oh, and about that dramatic thing outside... I think it's called Hamlet or something."},{"T":"301","2":"Sullie","3":"I don't have enough access to browse the documents. Can you take a look for me?"},{"T":"301","3":"Ishmael nods at the other people and starts checking the system. Her attention seems to focus on a single line. After a while, she shuts down the system."},{"T":"301","2":"Ishmael","3":"Alright. I'll take it over from here."}]
