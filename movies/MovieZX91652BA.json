[{"T":"301","3":"The Polyphage's silhouette becomes more apparent the further you follow Lamia down underground. The closer you are, the more its colossal size becomes evident, as well as the malevolence that seeps in."},{"T":"301","3":"Eventually, there is only a rift standing between the Polyphage and you. Below it, the Red Tide roils and crashes to the sides of the cliff."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"Hmph... This is where I come in. After all, you wouldn't be able to pull this off..."},{"T":"301","3":"The Punishing Virus crystalized under Lamia's command, forming a bridge that connects the rift, even if it only fits one person at a time."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Stop bragging. Get to work unless you want a bullet in you."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"A small compliment wouldn't hurt... Did you see how hard I've been trying to help you?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"I'm not buying it. There's no way you'll genuinely help us."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"Hehe, after all, I'm just a poor little fish in your leash. I'd do anything you tell me to."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"I'd rather live than be eaten alive by the Polyphage."},{"T":"301","3":"Lamia nods while maintaining her control on the bridge."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"Well, I didn't want to be eaten... So I escaped."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"But consuming Miss Luna has given it more than enough power... Now we all get to be desserts..."},{"T":"302","2":"How can we stop the Polyphage?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"I'm afraid the only way is to get Luna out of there... Or..."},{"T":"301","3":"Liv falls silent. What she meant to say is plain as day."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Lee, Liv, can you take Commandant back to the surface and call for reinforcement?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"...Why?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"If you take Lamia with you, she should be able to help you bypass the signal blockade and reach Babylonia."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"...Are you trying to get us out of here?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Lucia, what about you?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Someone has to hold off the Polyphage. With how powerful it's become, it will be countless lives spared if I can just hold it back for a few seconds."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Besides, Luna is still inside there. I..."},{"T":"301","3":"Lee cuts Lucia off before she finishes."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Then we go together."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...I'm the leader of Gray Raven. Doing so is too risky, and... irrational. I will not put Commandant and you in danger for my judgment."},{"T":"302","2":"That is why..."},{"T":"302","2":"You need us."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Commandant's right. What's irrational is splitting up in the face of that."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"If it were a strategic decision, I would have accepted it without question and given it my all."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"But it's not the right move here, and you're clearly doing so because you thought this is just your burden to carry. I'm not going to allow that."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"I..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"You might be the leader here, and we're supposed to follow your orders, but\u2014we are also your friends."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Just like what Lee said, Lucia."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"We still don't know our way around here. We could easily get into trouble on our way back."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Besides, Gray Raven is at its best when we are together, right?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...I understand. Thank you."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"That's what we're here for."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"Hehe... Such a touching display of camaraderie! I'm so jealous!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"But I'm also pretty fed up."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"?!"},{"T":"301","3":"Suddenly, Lee feels a searing burn in his palm.
