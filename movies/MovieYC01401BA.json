Faced with the weird Construct, the bionic bear looks as if it just ate ten barrels of expired bionic fish."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"HA!"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Just... stop HA-ing already!"},{"T":"301","3":"The bear roars, trying to stop the Construct from continuing her inane actions. The Construct shows brief surprise, but quickly recovers and hops off the rock with a beaming smile, happy that some-bear has answered."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Finally! A mechy teddy that speaks! All the other bearoids just pounced on me without a word! Yay, finally! A talking bear!"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"...You can't have been just HA-ing the whole time before I got here, can you?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Well... Nanami ain't so sure of the situation here, so I tried communicating with body language."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"HA!"},{"T":"301","3":"In the middle of Nanami's explanation, she takes on the strange pose from before again, even sprinkling in a 'HA' at the end."},{"T":"301","3":"It dawns on the bear that Nanami is trying to communicate with bionic mechanoids through her unfathomable pose and laughter."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"I mean... We're bionic machines, but that doesn't mean we converse through these... poses... And please, stop with the HAs too."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Ehehe, then I'll do it the normal way! Now that I know you can speak, mechy teddy-o, can you tell me where I am?"},{"T":"301","2":"Martin","3":"Stop calling me a mechy teddy! I have a name\u2014Martin. Just call me Martin."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Martin, hmm... That's no cute bear name at all."},{"T":"301","2":"Martin","3":"Wasn't trying to be!"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Aaanyhow, Nanami kinda just went around and found herself here. So what's this place? I don't have a map..."},{"T":"301","2":"Martin","3":"You just went around and found yourself here...? Do you have a boat? Or can you swim?"},{"T":"301","2":"Martin","3":"Agh, whatever, it doesn't matter. This place is part of the Arctic Route Union's territory, one of the largest human settlements."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Hmm, never heard of it before. But it does feel like Nanami's gone pretty pretty far far away... Now, now, what to do...?"},{"T":"301","2":"Martin","3":"You came all the way over here for no reason?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Hey, it's just a Nanami pleasure trip. What about you then, Marty?"},{"T":"301","2":"Martin","3":"I... I think I'm supposed to be shooting down some aircraft."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Supposed?"},{"T":"301","3":"Martin's bear-like features twist into one of visible hesitation, but he answers Nanami shortly."},{"T":"301","2":"Martin","3":"Yeah. I have to get the anti-air weaponry ready to shoot down some aircraft. No time to mess around with you here."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Okay then! The court of Nanami has reached its decision!"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Nanami will help you shoot down your planes!"},{"T":"301","2":"Martin","3":"Wha\u2014You? But the ones on the aircraft are..."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Constructs and humans, right? It'll be alright! You're only supposed to shoot down the 'aircraft,' yeah? Just hand over the artillery commands to Nanami!"},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami climbs atop the Nanami-rock as a pedestal again, then points one finger at the sky."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"We can just shoot down the planes without hurting the people on it, Morty!"}]
