Go home where it's safe."},{"T":"301","3":"Hearing this, Pfaff realizes that the bionic tide is coming today."},{"T":"301","2":"Pfaff","3":"Where is the tide coming from?"},{"T":"301","2":"Port Manager","3":"Huh? Like always, from the surrounding forest... Same deal this time..."},{"T":"301","3":"Quickly paying the knife seller, Pfaff turns and hurries into the forest."},{"T":"301","2":"Knife Seller","3":"Oi, gramps! Your change!"},{"T":"301","2":"Pfaff","3":"Rosetta! Are you here?!"},{"T":"301","3":"Pfaff shoves open the small door to the cabin. There are no signs of invasion by the tide, but Rosetta is nowhere to be found."},{"T":"301","3":"Pfaff has previously ordered Rosetta to leave a note whenever she would leave home."},{"T":"301","2":"Pfaff","3":"If only I hadn't gone out at this time... Rosetta... Where in God's name are you?"},{"T":"301","3":"His intuition tells him that Rosetta's disappearance must be related to the bionic tide."},{"T":"301","3":"And as if confirming Pfaff's thoughts, the characteristic roars of the bionics resound from outside the door."},{"T":"301","2":"Bionic Machine","3":"GAAWR...!"},{"T":"301","2":"Pfaff","3":"Damn it!"},{"T":"301","3":"Pfaff rushes out the door with an alacrity that betrays his old age.

More begin to surround Pfaff."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"(Whistles)"},{"T":"301","3":"A short whistle travels through the air, and over a dozen spears plummet from the sky, impaling the bionics that surrounded Pfaff."},{"T":"301","3":"Crisp clip-clops of hooves approach. A centaur-shaped Construct leaps over the bushes and stands beside Pfaff."},{"T":"301","2":"Temia","3":"My name is Temia, a member of the Forest Guard. Are you injured, sir?"},{"T":"301","3":"Seeing this strange Construct introduce herself as a Forest Guard, Pfaff furrows his brows and shifts, quietly avoiding eye contact."},{"T":"301","3":"Taking Pfaff's silence for shock, Temia strides over to comfort him. Before reaching Pfaff, however, a bionic\u2014not completely destroyed\u2014suddenly hurls itself at her."},{"T":"301","2":"Bionic Machine","3":"ROAAR\u2014arghhh!!!"},{"T":"301","3":"A blast from Pfaff's shotgun punches a hole straight through the bionic's chest.

But why?"},{"T":"301","2":"Forest Guard","3":"There are quite a few bionic footprints nearby.

Hey!"},{"T":"301","2":"Temia","3":"Forest Guards, stay on guard and follow the hunter. Move out!"},{"T":"301","3":"Rosetta is cautiously hiding behind a fallen tree. She sniffs the air."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"The smell of vital fluid... They're still moving up the mountain!"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"I should've warned the girls not to go into the forest when I saw them off in the distance!"},{"T":"301","3":"Rosetta is keeping her promise with Pfaff\u2014to not speak or meet with outsiders."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Two options left now...
