The show is over!"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"What an opening act! You've saved me a lot of work, let me tell you that. As for the audience who tried to sneak in without a ticket... I think a little punishment is in order, no?"},{"T":"301","3":"Roland does not bother to restrain Voodoo, who is no match for him now that Cerberus has worn him down.
