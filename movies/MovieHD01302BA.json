[{"T":"301","3":"Inside the Exhibition Hall."},{"T":"301","3":"Despite the shabby exterior, the residents have decorated the interior of the temporarily erected building to the best extent of their abilities."},{"T":"301","3":"All kinds of colored lights and ribbons hang from the rafters, wood panels pave the floor, and various flowers and plants are placed in every corner."},{"T":"301","3":"You can tell that people have high expectations for the celebration."},{"T":"301","3":"With activities in the exhibition as the highlight of the day, many people eagerly visit the stalls one after another."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Is everyone here hoping to be the 'Celebration Star'?"},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia carefully observes the crowd as if sizing up the competition."},{"T":"301","3":"Aside from the stall owners, most of the visitors are children. Their eyes are beaming with excitement and curiosity. She notices the twinkling 'stars' in their hands."},{"T":"301","3":"Those are what the stall owners are aiming for."},{"T":"301","3":"The stars cut from scraps of aluminum foil are referred to as 'Star Tickets'. They are how the 'Celebration Star' is chosen."},{"T":"301","3":"Whoever collects the most of these special silver stars during today's celebration will be elected as the 'Celebration Star' and receive a prize prepared by everyone in the conservation area."},{"T":"301","3":"Most of the booths in the exhibition hall were prepared for children in the conservation area. Children can select their favorite booths to give them Star Tickets."},{"T":"301","3":"Therefore, the biggest theme for this event is making the children happy so that the stall owners will be given their stars."},{"T":"301","3":"Even though it has nothing to do with 'White Day'..."},{"T":"302","2":"I see."},{"T":"301","3":"After careful observation, you see numerous booths with carnival games suited for two players so that both couples and groups of children can enjoy themselves."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"You're seriously interested in playing those games?"},{"T":"302","2":"Ahem... Let's go to our booth first."},{"T":"301","3":"You point to a spot in the exhibition hall where four white circles are marked with chalk, and the names of the Gray Ravens are written on the edges."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Did you prepare anything, Commandant...?"},{"T":"302","2":"You could say that..."},{"T":"301","3":"Your heart sinks a little at the thought. After all, you did not have much free time and energy to rehearse."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"It'll be okay. After all, you said having fun is what counts, right?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Then let's get started."},{"T":"301","3":"As time goes on, Gray Raven's performance begins to draw a crowd."},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia's performance is a blade dance."},{"T":"301","3":"Without any background music, only the noises in the venue are her accompaniment. Her bold yet beautiful movement is like a feather dropped by a passing bird."},{"T":"301","3":"Her blade technique is as refined and beautiful as ever. Her coating flows fluidly and nimbly, reflecting her heroism."},{"T":"301","3":"As several children step forward to see Lucia's blade more clearly, she slows her movements while keeping a safe distance from them."},{"T":"301","3":"As for Liv's performance..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"'A young man came to a city where its golden apple trees no longer bore fruit. He told the citizens, 'if you drive away the mice that gnaw at the roots, you can once again harvest golden apples.' Hearing this, the citizens gave him lots of treasure as a reward...'"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"'The young man then approached the fountain, which had run dry. The guards asked for his help, to which he responded, 'if you drive away the toads beneath the stones, the fountain will once again flow with water.' Hearing this, the guards were very grateful to him and gave him two donkeys loaded with gold...'"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"'Finally, the young man returned home. When his wife saw him and heard of his great deeds, her happiness was to the moon and back..'"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"'From then on, they lived happily ever after...'"},{"T":"301","3":"Sitting together with the children, Liv softly tells them a sweet fairytale. Unafraid of her, a little girl leans on her lap like a chick to its mother, letting Liv gently stroke her hair."},{"T":"301","3":"The children quietly wait for the next story, which seems at odds with the bustling venue."},{"T":"301","3":"But the most popular performance of all is..."},{"T":"301","2":"Child A","3":"Wow! How did you do that, Mister?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Child B","3":"Yeah! Yeah! There's nothing up your sleeve!"},{"T":"301","2":"Child C","3":"And... and... where did the pigeon go?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Child D","3":"Do it again! Do it again! I wanna see it fly out again! It's amazing!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Watch closely..."},{"T":"301","3":"First, Lee shows everyone the empty hat. Then, he reaches his hand into the hat, then suddenly\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"Colorful ribbons and playing cards burst out from the hat!"},{"T":"301","3":"He snaps his fingers again, and a small cloud of smoke bursts from his fingertips. The playing cards pass through the smoke and turn into candy as they fall to the ground."},{"T":"301","3":"As the children race to pick up the candy, Lee appears to relax a little."},{"T":"302","2":"(Look away)"},{"T":"301","3":"Right as you think that their performances seem to be a hit with the crowd, you feel someone tugging at your curtails."},{"T":"301","2":"Girl","3":"What are you performing?"},{"T":"301","3":"Perhaps she is curious why you have only been standing in the corner, or maybe the Gray Raven's wonderful performances have raised her expectations."},{"T":"301","3":"Either way, the girl's eyes beam with anticipation as she pulls at your clothes."},{"T":"302","2":"Show time."},{"T":"301","3":"After you finish performing, the performances from Lee and the others also gradually come to an end."},{"T":"301","2":"Girl","3":"Well... Here, take this... Don't feel too bad about yourself..."},{"T":"301","3":"The little girl shakes your hand in encouragement before putting three Star Tickets in your hand."},{"T":"301","3":"The others look over."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"How many stars did you get? I... I only have seventeen. I'm sorry. I don't think it's a lot."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"I got twenty-two... It's okay Liv. We're a team. Our stars will be counted together."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Forty-five."},{"T":"301","3":"With such an amazing performance, you are not surprised Lee is able to get so many tickets."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Commandant?"},{"T":"302","2":"I..."},{"T":"301","3":"You open your hand, revealing your Star Tickets."},{"T":"302","2":"Th-three..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Huh?"},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia is speechless as if completely caught by surprise."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"M-maybe... your dance was too abstract for the children to really understand it."},{"T":"302","2":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"I thought your dance was wonderful, Commandant."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"It showed both strength and practicality. The final part where you were crawling and contorting your body was impeccable."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"I wouldn't exactly call that 'dancing'..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Anyway... enough about that. Has everyone thought about where they want to go next?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Yes... I want to check out the market. Looks like there are more events for us to earn Star Tickets."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Liv?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Oh, me? I'm not sure yet..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"In terms of efficiency, splitting up is the fastest way to obtain more Star Tickets."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Choose whichever event best suits you."},{"T":"302","2":"Even then..."},{"T":"302","2":"Just walking around and checking out the celebration is okay, too."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"The commandant's right. How about we just take a break?"},{"T":"302","2":"Alright, let's set a time to meet back up."},{"T":"302","2":"Enjoy the celebration until then."}]
