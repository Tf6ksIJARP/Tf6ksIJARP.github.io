If it hadn't been for that thing you brought back, I wouldn't have improved so much."},{"T":"301","2":"Selena","3":"\u2026\u2026"},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Well, this is what Miss Luna has hoped for."},{"T":"301","2":"\u03b1","3":"Just don't lose to the Babylonia people again."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"That's blunt. I will try."},{"T":"301","3":"The Ascendants are gathered in an empty church. Sunlight sneaks through the cracks in the walls and falls on their elegant figures."},{"T":"301","2":"? ? ?","3":"That's it? You will try?"},{"T":"301","3":"The church door slowly opens. Hearing the sound behind them, Roland and Gabriel stand to attention and salute. Alpha walks over to the door in a welcoming manner."},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"So... is that all you have to say? You will try?"},{"T":"301","3":"The owner of the voice, Luna, walks over and asks again, her manner brisk and passionless."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Yes, Miss Luna, I will try."},{"T":"301","3":"Alpha furrows her eyebrows at Roland's answer. Gabriel shivers a little but quickly regains his calm."},{"T":"301","3":"\u2014"},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"Mm, I will be watching."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Thank you."},{"T":"301","3":"Luna's timely smile relaxes the tension before it escalates into something ugly. A certain someone feels relieved. Meanwhile, Roland and Gabriel finish their salute."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Since Miss Luna is here, why don't you update us on the progress of your mission... Miss Lamia."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Miss Lamia?"},{"T":"301","3":"Gabriel quickly moves on to the next topic, but this Lamia girl is unresponsive, as if she was somewhere else."},{"T":"301","2":"\u03b1","3":"I haven't seen her since I got here..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"You've been hiding here all along, have you, Lamia? Show up right now, or I'm gonna blow this place up."},{"T":"301","2":"? ? ?","3":"Wait, wait, wait! Are you a devil!?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Not a devil, but an Ascendant. Now stop being invisible and show yourself!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"I'm here. Just lower your gun. I surrender!"},{"T":"301","3":"Succumbing to Roland's threat, a monstrous feminine figure emerges from a dark corner. Despite her timid manner, she is actually an Ascendant working under Luna."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"I just want to remind you it's time to quit slacking and get back to work."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"I... I'm not slacking. I went to Akdilek and that disgusting ship... like I was told to."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"I went into invisibility... only because I don't like crowds..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Which is another way of saying 'slacking off'.

I think I failed."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"The leaders of Kowloong Corp refused to get on board with our plan, but neither would they be complicit in Babylonia's plot."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"They said they'd rather decide the future of Earth on their own, without meddling from anyone."},{"T":"301","2":"\u03b1","3":"How naive! Do they honestly think they can be neutral in a world like this?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"So don't get mad at me. I'm just the messenger!"},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"My sister is not mad at you. She just can't understand their stupidity."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"But can you understand it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"Neither can I, of course."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"So, Miss Luna, does that mean..."},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"The power of Heteromers is under our control. Roland's frame has been enhanced. And most importantly, Babylonia is on its way to becoming a corporation."},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"We can't let Babylonia beat us to it. Everyone, it's time to move."},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"Just as Kowloong said."},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"We will decide the future of Earth!"}]
