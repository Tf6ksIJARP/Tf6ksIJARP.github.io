[{"T":"301","2":"Construct","3":"Good thing we rendezvoused in time. Quickly, escort the civilians to the safe zone. Everyone else, keep an eye on the bionics!"},{"T":"301","2":"Fisher","3":"Err' damn cannonslinger, get your asses over 'ere!"},{"T":"301","3":"The base is in turmoil. One group of humans is engaging with the bionics approaching the base, while another is hastily preparing for the next wave of attacks."},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"...Ugh, I'm sorry. I don't feel so..."},{"T":"301","3":"Simon, neither a Construct nor piloting a Polar Soldier, had no choice but to hitch a ride on Diana."},{"T":"301","3":"Upon reaching the base, Simon could no longer hold his grip and tumbles off of Diana, rolling onto the ground."},{"T":"302","2":"Are you okay?","4":"Didn't you go through training in Babylonia?"},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"Phew... I-I just need a quick breather..."},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"Argh... My physical training grades were just average... Ngh..."},{"T":"301","3":"Before he could finish, he signals for a open path and scurries behind the shade. By the look of things, he is likely going to be out of action for some time."},{"T":"301","2":"Atiel","3":"Simon's always like this. I'll go look after him."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"The code! Did you guys find it?!"},{"T":"301","3":"Captain Staessen pushes his way from out of the crowd. Handing over the command to one of his subordinates, he begins to shake Atiel vigorously."},{"T":"302","2":"Calm down!","4":"Derek's voice is the code."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"How can I calm down at a time like this? Do you know how dire the situation is? What on earth is the code to control Amberia?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"It's Derek. More specifically, it's his voice."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"Derek... You mean that mechanic narwhal?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"Wait... Why is that mechanical narwhal's voice the code? They're using a voice to control Amberia?"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"I can't tell what they were thinking either, but I'm afraid it's true. Derek's voice is specifically designed to resonate with the frequency of humanoid-hybrid M.I.N.D.s."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"How is that possible?"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"You must know what I mean, Commandant. You saw it firsthand."},{"T":"302","2":"Our last time in the ARU..."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Yeah. Derek's voice was the main reason I wasn't taken by the virus. I didn't realize at the time, but looking back, Derek may be the key to everything."},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"Now that you mention it, even though Derek swims all over the world, he always returns at a specific time."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"The ebb and flow of the tide... You mean, that narwhal is the key to putting Amberia to rest?"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Looks like it..."},{"T":"302","2":"Where is Derek now?","4":"Will Derek be returning soon?"},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"...Who knows where that blasted narwhal is!"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"He usually shows up at about this time, so he should have. We all assumed it was part of his migration cycle, but this time, Derek is running late."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"As a result..."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Derek might be malfunctioning. The reason being..."},{"T":"302","2":"\u03b1"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"That must be it. Alpha had her eyes on Derek during her last visit, and in trying to 'tame' him, she must have caused a system malfunction."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"Then what do we do? No Derek, no code..."},{"T":"302","2":"Evan has the code."},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"Why Evan... Ah..."},{"T":"301","3":"Diana suddenly recalls the last time she saw Evan."},{"T":"301","2":"Evan","3":"Supersonic Derek Wahoo!"},{"T":"301","2":"Player","3":"'\u2014\u2014'"},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"That's definitely Derek's voice.. Wait, where's Evan?"},{"T":"301","2":"Evan","3":"Wah!"},{"T":"301","3":"Before you could react, Evan has already fallen to the ground. A familiar female Construct has snatched the voice player around his neck, radiating a terrifying smile on her face."},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"A-Atiel?!"},{"T":"302","2":"(Shoot grapple at her)","4":"(Charge at her)"},{"T":"301","3":"You pilot the Polar Soldier to attack Atiel."},{"T":"301","2":"Atiel","3":"\u2014\u2014!"},{"T":"301","3":"The grappling hook scratches Atiel's torso, causing vitual fluid to spray out."},{"T":"301","2":"Atiel","3":"Ugh... Dammit!"},{"T":"301","3":"You pilot the Polar Soldier to attack Atiel."},{"T":"301","2":"Atiel","3":"Boss, you're way off mark."},{"T":"301","3":"Atiel dodges your charge, but Rosetta quickly follows with a throw of her spear."},{"T":"301","2":"Atiel","3":"What?!"},{"T":"301","3":"The spear strikes Atiel, causing vital fluid to spray out."},{"T":"301","2":"Atiel","3":"Cough... Dammit!"},{"T":"301","3":"The terrain, however, makes the attack ineffectual, giving Atiel an opportunity to escape and run the other way."},{"T":"301","3":"Rosetta activates her light wings and flies into the air."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Catch her, Commandant!"}]
