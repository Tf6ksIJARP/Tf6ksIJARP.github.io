Making my way through this dark path through the stratum, I arrive at a familiar city that should have died out during the Golden Age."},{"T":"301","3":"The survivors of the battle built this unknown 'cemetery' with bricks and tiles of the KCC."},{"T":"301","3":"It rests peacefully under the Kowloong Metropolis, where it should remain undisturbed."},{"T":"301","3":"An artificial sun hangs above this underground complex, creating a day and night cycle for the humans that reside here."},{"T":"301","3":"Faint blue shadows stroll in the street. They are the masters here. Several groups gather here talking amongst each other."},{"T":"301","3":"As I walk along the path, my surroundings distort momentarily before a familiar face appears next to me."},{"T":"301","2":"Bai Gui","3":"Lady Qu, do you really want to accept that offer?"},{"T":"301","2":"Qu","3":"I have no reason not to accept. We must understand what each party seeks to gain."},{"T":"301","2":"Bai Gui","3":"Yes, but..."},{"T":"301","2":"Qu","3":"Don't worry. If anything were to happen to me, then the last person with access to this place will be gone. Isn't it safer this way?"},{"T":"301","2":"Qu","3":"Of course, I will not allow for any accidents.

The people of Kowloong all know."},{"T":"301","3":"After saying farewell to Bai Gui, I walk aimlessly along the path. My vision module scans the buildings in front of me.

Want me to recite it for you?"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"That won't be necessary."},{"T":"301","2":"Villier","3":"The doctrine only defines one central dogma. Imperial learning is only a political tool of mankind. We should not restrict ourselves too much; results are of utmost priority."},{"T":"301","2":"Qu","3":"Do not be swayed by emotions. Instead, act accordingly to the situation at hand. Grace should be given with purpose."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"That's right."},{"T":"301","3":"The man chuckles at Qu and Villier's answers. Pressing a button on his wheelchair, he proceeds to the end of the corridor."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"You both have embodied these principles during your recent public speeches. You bring hope to those in despair and impose sanctions on your opponents. Keep it up.
