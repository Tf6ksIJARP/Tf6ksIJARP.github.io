Even with the support from Akdilek, we're still unable to avoid this plight."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"...This is just the way it is. They were devices deployed long ago, after all. See if you can recycle anything from the stash."},{"T":"301","2":"Forsaken Member A","3":"Roger."},{"T":"301","3":"Inside the Forsaken hideout, the well-organized Watanabe is giving out directives."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"Next."},{"T":"301","2":"Forsaken Member B","3":"The area around here has been getting more dangerous recently. Should we..."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"Have the scouts assess our surroundings again. We'll move our hideout if their report comes to the same conclusion."},{"T":"301","2":"Forsaken Member B","3":"Understood. I'll join the scouting party as well, then."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"Don't linger. Retreat if you have to, understood?"},{"T":"301","2":"Forsaken Member B","3":"Of course, sir."},{"T":"301","3":"The Forsaken might be an organization of a certain scale, but the lack of resources has kept them in a passive position for a very long time."},{"T":"301","3":"Every move they make, Watanabe and the Forsakens are always walking on thin ice in order to keep all of their members safe."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"Alright, next."},{"T":"301","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"Hmm, next?"},{"T":"301","2":"Child A","3":"Here, Mr. Watanabe!"},{"T":"301","3":"The multitasking Watanabe is so occupied that he has not noticed the significantly shorter company seeking consultation."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"Ugh, kids..."},{"T":"301","2":"Child A","3":"We ain't no kids!

If you're asking for candies, I'm sorry, but those are needed elsewhere."},{"T":"301","2":"Child A","3":"That's not why we're here!"},{"T":"301","3":"The group of kids protests by giving Watanabe the stink eye.

I suppose that's worth responding. Do we have any devices that can connect to the satellite?"},{"T":"301","2":"Forsaken Member C","3":"We do. But, sir, are you going to show up on their screen like this?"},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"Sure, what's wrong with it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Forsaken Member C","3":"Everything! We can't have the Babylonians seeing the face and leader of the Forsaken covered in dirt.
