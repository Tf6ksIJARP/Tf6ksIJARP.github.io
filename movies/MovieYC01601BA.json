But this is my log, so he can go cry about it."},{"T":"301","3":"Now, where was I? Oh, her eyes were as cold as ever, but there was a trace of loneliness."},{"T":"301","3":"I don't know why, but I think I understand her loneliness. I heard that Lucia was seriously wounded during her last mission, and her entire team and commandant died except for her."},{"T":"301","3":"Ever since then, she appeared to be unaffected, but I sensed a change in her."},{"T":"301","3":"Now, she is the only remaining member of her Gray Raven team."},{"T":"301","3":"I would've loved for the opportunity to fight at her side. With this in mind, I remained in the training room once training was over."},{"T":"301","3":"What was I doing at that time? Oh, right. I was waiting in the doorway to say hello to Lucia. Wait, no. I first gave her a salute, then said hello."},{"T":"301","3":"Then I complimented Lucia's achievements, expressed my appreciation for her\u2014for the Gray Ravens\u2014then put forward my wish to join the Gray Ravens."},{"T":"301","3":"...Or should I say, I wanted to, but I ended up just staring at Lucia as she left the training room. She didn't even look my way as she walked passed me."},{"T":"301","3":"After being too shy to ask, I missed my opportunity and had no other choice but to submit my application to the Gray Ravens. I was rejected, of course. That's why I was assigned to my current team."},{"T":"301","3":"Why would the renowned Gray Raven team need a mediocre member like me..."},{"T":"301","3":"Training Log: VOCALTEXT10310"},{"T":"301","3":">>> Status: Hidden"},{"T":"301","3":"Operations and simulation training are no different after joining my team. Most of my missions are just cleaning up Corrupted around the conservation area, setting up equipment, investigating Corrupted, and then submitting reports to the special exploration squads."},{"T":"301","3":"The commandant seems to deliberately forbid me from undertaking more difficult missions. Maybe since I'm not as strong as our leader and Teresa, I'll just end up getting in the way during more important assignments."},{"T":"301","3":"So I have to train harder.

I saw Lucia again in the training room."},{"T":"301","3":"I finally got to see Lucia unleash 'Dawn'. Seems like she's getting ready for a mission on the ground."},{"T":"301","3":"Her crimson pigtails and the red light trails emitted by the high-powered frame were so dazzling that I couldn't look away."},{"T":"301","3":"But something was up with Lucia. I heard someone from the tech department say that she wanted to modify the frame's hairstyle."},{"T":"301","3":"I don't think that's a good idea, though. I think she's lovely just the way she is!"},{"T":"301","3":"I wish someone would tell her that. I'm too much of a chicken to do it myself."},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia's been acting differently, though. She used to have this cold, empty look in her eyes as if fighting was the only thing she was meant to do."},{"T":"301","3":"But recently, there seems to be something else besides emptiness in her eyes. She still occasionally drifts off, but someone always comes looking for her to drag her off to somewhere noisy."},{"T":"301","3":"Sometimes there's a quiet and delicate-looking girl who I'm guessing is a member of the Gray Ravens. Sometimes there's a hot-headed girl always clamoring to one-up Lucia."},{"T":"301","3":"Most of the time, it's the Gray Ravens' new commandant always talking to Lucia with a gentle smile. She used to be really tense, but she seems to have loosened up more than ever."},{"T":"301","3":"There's also the Strike Hawk member who always looks like he's giggling from behind. He runs off to the Gray Ravens' base even more than me, but then he just ends up getting dragged back by the captain of the Strike Hawks."},{"T":"301","3":"But he always bursts in through the door while I try to pass by unnoticed."},{"T":"301","3":"Before I knew it, Lucia had quite the entourage."},{"T":"301","3":"Battle Log: VOCALTEXT0331"},{"T":"301","3":">>> Status: Hidden"},{"T":"301","3":"Before that, I never considered the possibility that I will die."},{"T":"301","3":"Death is inevitable for humans, but I'm a Construct."},{"T":"301","3":"As those who modified us into Constructs said, we can recall our consciousnesses if we are seriously injured in battle."},{"T":"301","3":"Once recalled, we will wake up in a new frame and continue to fight another day."},{"T":"301","3":"Recalling does have one side effect, though. Our combat data will take precedence over other memory data during recall. If there is any error with the recall process, we may end up losing memories."},{"T":"301","3":"But based on what our battle-hardened predecessors have said, there isn't enough time to recall on the battlefield. Each moment of hesitation during war determines its outcome and your companions' survival. That's one of the cruelties of war."},{"T":"301","3":"If I recall on the battlefield, will I still be 'me' when I wake up in a maintenance pod in Babylonia?"},{"T":"301","3":"The captain was furious. He said that I needed to get my head out of the clouds. My commandant won't always be able to stop and adjust my M.I.N.D."},{"T":"301","3":"I can only bow my head and apologize to the captain. The commandant spoke up for me, but that only makes me feel even more guilty."},{"T":"301","3":"If it weren't for the commandant and captain of this mission, I might have died from the attacking Corrupted. I wasn't expecting to encounter falling Hetero-Core shards during such a routine mission. The shards ended up luring a horde of Corrupted."},{"T":"301","3":"I couldn't keep my mind from wandering.
