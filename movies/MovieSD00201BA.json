A gorgeous-looking Construct in pink walks up."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"\u2014Liv, here you are! I'm so, so sorry for taking up the space in your lounge!"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"I-it's okay... But, eh, are we... moving?"},{"T":"301","3":"Looking at the piles of cardboard boxes in the room, Liv is understandably confused."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"Of course not! C'mon, Liv, check this out! I'm sure you'll find it interesting!"},{"T":"301","3":"Ayla puts her arm around Liv as she speaks and gestures toward the door theatrically."},{"T":"301","3":"As if on cue, the door slowly opens to reveal... an enormous, lush, emerald tree planted in an extravagant planter."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"That's... just..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Indeed, that's just a silver wattle, a common evergreen tree in the genus Acacia of the Fabaceae family. It prefers sunlight instead of shade, so I'd suggest putting it in a garden instead of our lounge..."},{"T":"301","3":"Lee appears out of nowhere, his arms crossed. It seems like the boxes have taken over his desk and covered him entirely."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"Lee, you know your plants!"},{"T":"301","3":"Ayla grins, completely ignoring Lee's complaint."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"Then you should also know that a silver wattle is excellent as a\u2014"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"If that's what you're after, you should have used the one in the genus Abies of the Abietoideae subfamily under the Pinales order\u2014"},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"Stop nitpicking! I've spent a lot of effort moving this tree from the botanic garden to here!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"It doesn't seem like you've spent much effort at all."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"Oh, c'mon, I did spend a lot of money on it!"},{"T":"301","3":"Ayla's hand gently strokes the tree, rustling its beautiful, lush leaves.

It's a Christmas present for your commandant from me. I want to decorate it and turn it into a proper, festive Christmas tree!"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Oh my... This year's Christmas tree?"},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"But I'd require your assistance."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"B-but you're a member of the WGAA.

This is just a common silver wattle for now\u2014but when you adorn it with all the gifts everyone's preparing for your commandant, it'll become a gorgeous Christmas Tree filled with love!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"I don't think it'll make any difference giving our presents to the commandant ourselves or hanging them on a tree..."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"Which means you have prepared a present for the commandant, haven't you?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Lee..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Actually...
