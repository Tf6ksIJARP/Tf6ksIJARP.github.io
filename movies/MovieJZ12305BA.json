The prop team always fails to clean up the place. Cough."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Least I managed to avoid those mechanoids. I need a rest. Phew..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"It'd be safer to barricade myself in here, but I don't know what's going on. Can't believe my EMP baton broke at a time like this."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"This is... so strange. Did hackers attack the park? Or is there some new virus that forces machines to attack humans?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"I don't know enough to even know where to start. I should sever the connection to the park first. If it's a virus or hackers, that should cut their connection."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"I need to get in touch with the outside world... A phone... Grr, I can't get through."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Can't say I'm surprised. Whether it's hackers or a virus, of course they'd cut off external communication if they can control so many mechanoids."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Backup plan. I need a backup plan. Let's see. There should be a bunch of terminals lying around here somewhere..."},{"T":"301","3":"The emergency phone in the drawer... Doesn't work. The fire safety line in the basement... Damaged. Walkie-talkies in the cabinet... Scrapped."},{"T":"301","3":"Audience communication terminal under the clown masks hanging on the wall..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"It's ringing. Heh, guess the big man upstairs is throwin' me a bone... If only it was a different occasion."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Current viewers... Great, there are still people online."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Need to hurry. First, I'll screen out all unstable signals, then call the last caller... Got one, viewer 6875."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Oh, it's that overbearing woman. Whatever. It's an emergency. Now's not the time to care."},{"T":"301","3":"Or is it? Roland hangs his hand on the terminal and hesitates."},{"T":"301","3":"Directly talking with a viewer like this will ruin the show and expose the truth to the world."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"The director's going to yell at me."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"...Bahahah! Go right ahead. The fee for breaking the contract can't be more than my life."},{"T":"301","3":"Roland smiles bitterly and shakes his head. Still worried about something like that when his own life is in danger... It really is hard to take off the mask after wearing it for so long."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"I just hope Mom and Dad won't be angry."},{"T":"301","3":"Roland inputs several commands and submits the request. A woman's face appears on the holo-screen."},{"T":"301","2":"Viewer","3":"Hello? WHAT?! Am I dreaming?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Viewer","3":"Oh, gosh! It's Roland! Roland called me?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Hello, miss."},{"T":"301","3":"Her shrill voice causes Roland to wince, but he has no choice. Everything is riding on her."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Uh, yes... Miss, actually... I..."},{"T":"301","2":"Viewer","3":"Shh, Roland. You don't have to say another word! Call the police, right? Got it!"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Huh? Miss, you know..."},{"T":"301","2":"Viewer","3":"Of course, I do. First, the screen went black. After that, the cameras kept changing, but I saw everything."},{"T":"301","2":"Viewer","3":"You running and looking for a place to hide, then ending up in that conference room. I saw the whole crisis!"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Oh, haha. Thanks for being such a loyal viewer... Anyway, please call the police ASAP."},{"T":"301","2":"Viewer","3":"Alrighty, you got it!"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Phew..."},{"T":"301","3":"With a sigh of relief, Roland's mind finally has the spare strength to assess the situation with the others."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"...The camera was filming me? Was the show recording everything I had just gone through automatically?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Oh, that must've been the screenwriter... Thanks. I hope we all get out of here alive."},{"T":"301","3":"(Clenches fist) We will. We just need to call the police. Everyone'll be saved once they get here. They'll put an end to the haywire mechanoids here in the park. After that, Mandy can be fixed up in no time..."},{"T":"301","2":"Viewer","3":"\u2014Ok, well have a nice day now! I've got other stuff to do."},{"T":"301","2":"Viewer","3":"I gotta say, this attempt at boosting audience participation is a bit ham-fisted... If I hadn't watched you so much, I would've actually called the police."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"...Huh?"},{"T":"301","2":"Viewer","3":"I knew it right from the start. Adventure shows get old quick. The acting's over the top and the product placement feels forced. And the script? Not good. Plot holes everywhere. A post-apocalyptic spinoff will make for a better sequel."},{"T":"301","2":"Viewer","3":"The crew's ditching the lead actor and they aren't even bothering to hide it, are they? But with you as the lead, I've got my hopes set high. Good luck on the sequel!"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"W-what? Miss, are you..."},{"T":"301","3":"Click. Right as she hangs up, Roland's holo-screen goes blank."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"...Is she crazy?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Sigh. Guess I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up. I need to hurry and find someone else to call..."},{"T":"301","3":"Seems this show just attracts viewers with an over-active imagination. Roland shakes his head and forgets everything she said just now."},{"T":"301","3":"He returns to the contact select screen and starts dialing each number within range."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Viewer 2986, no connection. Viewer 4689, busy..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Damn it. Not many people are watching now. Let's see if I can reach the main control room. Hopefully, someone there has a way of contacting to someone on the outside."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Viewer & ^%? Why are there random codes here? Forget it. No point in beating a dead horse."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"...It connected?!"},{"T":"301","3":"Surprised, Roland turns on the screen and begins to think of what to say. Maybe he was too relaxed when calling for help just now. Maybe he should show some tears. That'll get them to call the police quickly."},{"T":"301","3":"However, as the person appears on the holo-screen, Roland is rendered speechless."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Rolmo?! What are you doing there?"},{"T":"301","2":"Rolmo","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Rolmo","3":"Rococo's personality simulation program activated.

Long time no see."},{"T":"301","2":"Rolmo","3":"Detecting a fluctuation in Roland's mood parameters..."},{"T":"301","2":"Rolmo","3":"Why do you look so nervous, bro? Tired from the show?"},{"T":"301","2":"Rolmo","3":"Don't worry, everyone in the family supports you very much. They..."},{"T":"301","2":"Rolmo","3":"T-they... T-HeyY... Eyy..."},{"T":"301","2":"Rolmo","3":"...Material data error, existing data collection failed. Database failure expected.

You created an AI to simulate you. You're playing a prank, right?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Knock it off. Hehe... heh. Come on, bro. I'm in danger."},{"T":"301","2":"Rolmo","3":"Database reconnection not detected. Please resubmit your command."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"Roland reconnects and tries again several times."},{"T":"301","2":"Rolmo","3":"Please resubmit your command."},{"T":"301","2":"Rolmo","3":"Please resubmit your command."},{"T":"301","2":"Rolmo","3":"Please resubmit your command."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Heh... hehe... What sort of joke is this..."},{"T":"301","3":"BANG! Roland slams his fist on the control panel. The familiar face turns into a chaotic array of code and disappears."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"I've been speaking with that AI for so long. Did I really think of it as my brother...?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Was this the park's plan all along? Heh... Ridiculous..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"...Damn it. But now's not the time to think about this..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Living is the most important thing right now..."},{"T":"301","3":"Yes, it's no big deal. Living is the most important thing. Only by living can we continue to pursue what we want."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"I can't give up now... I still have a wish to make come true..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Hurry, think. What else can I do? What else can I do? Oh, right... Social media. I can log into the official account and send for help. Who cares what happens to the account. To hell with it."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Rerouting network, dialing connection... Connected. Looks like doing it the old way still works. Now I just gotta hurry up and log in."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Website doesn't exist? How's that possible? Guess I'll try again... Still nothing."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"...The website wasn't simulated by the AI, too, was it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"A simulation... I got the domain name from Rolmo's AI. I can't believe it's not\u2014"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"\u2014Fine. Guess I have to whether I like it or not."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"What's the big idea with the park? Would they really fake a website just to fool everyone?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"...I gotta get help first. I'll check Rococo Entertainment's official website."},{"T":"301","2":"Program","3":"Account detected. Connecting to account URL... Default advertisement detected."},{"T":"301","2":"Program","3":"Playing advertisement: 'Hologram Actor's Camp'. Runtime: 30 seconds."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"...An ad?"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"\u2014Hola, amigo!"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"In this golden age, are you tired of watching mechanoid performances without any tension? Are you tired of watching stand-ins give lack-luster performances? Look no further! The performance here is so genuine, it's real!"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"No over-the-top stunts, no smoke and mirrors, no editing magic. This broadcast is live in real-time! Watch our human protagonist's genuine, nail-biting reactions to a witty and humorous world of film."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"That voice..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Neferti...?"},{"T":"301","3":"Barely able to recognize the deep voice in the ad, Neferti appears on the holo-screen with an unfamiliar expression."},{"T":"301","2":"Neferti On-screen","3":"Yo! Yo! Welcome to our reality show. It's me, the one and only\u2014Neferti!"},{"T":"301","2":"Neferti On-screen","3":"As you all know, I am just an ordinary mechanoid. Even as I speak to you now, we are all coded to perform according to our programming. In other words, a puppet at the whims of the puppeteer."},{"T":"301","2":"Neferti On-screen","3":"But do you really know what 'real' is?"},{"T":"301","2":"Neferti On-screen","3":"\u2014The answer is, of course, our dear Roland!"},{"T":"301","2":"Neferti On-screen","3":"Our reality show, 'Hologram Actor's Camp' is celebrating its anniversary! Such a huge studio with only the protagonist Roland alone! No other human influence! From a child star to a superstar! Roland's growth as an actor for many years right before your own eyes!"},{"T":"301","2":"Neferti On-screen","3":"After all these years, Roland, who is now worried about truth and falsehood, is about to embark on the road to becoming a superstar! As his most loyal colleague, I, Neferti, will guide him on his journey! How will Roland's career change from now on? I bet you all are on the edge of your seats!"},{"T":"301","2":"Neferti On-screen","3":"Enjoy exciting stories, genuine experiences and answers to life's toughest questions! This is our reality show! This absolutely true story is a masterpiece of this era!"},{"T":"301","2":"Neferti On-screen","3":"Damas y caballeros (Ladies and gentlemen), the show is about to begin!"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Ah... ah... ahhh..."},{"T":"301","2":"Neferti On-screen","3":"Lastly, a word from our sponsor. 'Take a break and spice up your life.' Starting next week, entertainment leader..."},{"T":"301","3":"Watching the advertisement, Neferi's over-enthusiastic and familiar lines are like an ice-cold waterfall pouring on Roland's head."},{"T":"301","3":"The water slowly rises from the bottom of his feet up to his neck."},{"T":"301","3":"His body is freezing."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"(Vomits)"},{"T":"301","3":"The cold dizziness pulls at his stomach without giving him time to process it, causing him to vomit profusely."},{"T":"301","3":"He was long acquainted with this feeling. Every time he had to reboot Mandhasti, he had to endure intense nausea."},{"T":"301","3":"As the advertisement draws to an end, a flood of comments suddenly passes by the screen. Right at that moment, Roland sees several familiar IDs."},{"T":"301","3":"Praise, envy, expectation and worry. The stream of comments, carrying countless emotions, washes toward Roland. Similar content, similar tone, but its point is no longer the illusory Roland."},{"T":"301","3":"Indeed. Building such a large studio with the intent of keeping a human caged in it for decades without them realizing it is obviously impossible."},{"T":"301","3":"However, if that person thinks that they are the one deceiving others, it is more likely for them to think that those ubiquitous cameras are not pointed at them, and that the audience is not watching them either. That makes things much easier."},{"T":"301","3":"Overwork them, distract their mind with complex thoughts, then set up some things disguised as 'the outside world' so that they won't have any clue that they are really the star."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"W-why..."},{"T":"301","3":"A few seconds later, the advertisement ends with cheers from the audience. Regaining control over his limbs, Roland discovers it is his fingers that begin to move first."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"No, no, it's okay. Doesn't matter that I've been deceived this whole time. Now, I just need to think about how to survive..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Yes, even if it's all fake, it's all of those bastards in the park that did this to me. To hell with them. My parents and Rolmo are still waiting for me outside. As long as I live, I'll be able to see them."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Considering the situation now, I won't be able to log into the official account. But the advertisement said that I was the only human in the park, my contract must be somewhere in the database. I should be able to get my family's contact info on it."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Contract, contract. If I'm the only human, it should be easy to find... Hack the park's encrypted firewall, and I'll find it in no time... I'm coming, twerp."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"I've been working hard to maintain this life... I've put in so much blood, sweat, and tears... How can it all be fake..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Please... Anyone... Just tell me this is all a part of the rewrite. Tell me that if I leave, it'll all be over..."},{"T":"301","2":"Program","3":"Firewall disabled. Large-scale decryption initiated... Unidentified user access granted."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Presto."},{"T":"301","2":"Program","3":"Encrypted file found."},{"T":"301","2":"Program","3":"Decrypted.

Party B..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Ha-HA! Why didn't I think of this..."},{"T":"301","3":"Suddenly, something crashes into the door behind him, knocking over a pile of heavy objects stacked in the doorway."},{"T":"301","3":"Looking back, a hole is busted into the base of the door. Even though it is too small for someone to fit through, it is still big enough for Roland to see numerous mechanoids shouting as they attempt to squeeze through the door."},{"T":"301","3":"Even though their faces are destroyed and their eyes shining red, Roland could recognize his colleagues in the surging sea of mechanoids."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Neferti... Omi... The screenwriter..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Hahahah! Of course. All of you who kept me company, cared about me, and deceived me\u2014of course, you're all mechanoids. You guys didn't happen to do that twerp's AI, too? Haha!"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Not only that, but so far, the things I like, the things I hate, the things I stick to, the things I look forward to are all fakes made by you, right? Hahahaha..."},{"T":"301","3":"Turning off the terminal, Roland doesn't immediately run away from the door. Rather, he courteously gestures to the door with his arms gently raised and his feet apart like a noble knight greeting guests from afar."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"I see. The things in your hands look dangerous. Those aren't props. This time it's for real, isn't it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Alrighty then. Show me what you've got..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"If nothing is left, no name, no experiences, no past\u2014everything is fake\u2014wouldn't it be better just to get this boring life over and done with? Being here with you all now, yes, I wouldn't have it any other way."},{"T":"301","3":"The hole in the door bursts open. Roland watches as the first mechanoid crawls in through the hole. Perhaps it's a glitch, but he seems to be able to hear them mumbling to themselves."},{"T":"301","2":"Omi","3":"No, no, no! Roland, you've got the intonation wrong! You need to speak from your gut!"},{"T":"301","3":"Omi said this when she was training him to act. She was holding a rolled-up script as she prodded his abdomen and scolded him. Now, that iron bar in her hand would sure pierce right through him."},{"T":"301","2":"Screenwriter","3":"Roland, scene HZZ... Come on, chop, chop!"},{"T":"301","3":"Every time the director urged Roland to go to a scene, he would always speak in a hurry. It sounded like two knives stabbing into his ears from his earpiece. Now it liked like he actually wanted to stab him in the ears with those two sharp knives in his hands."},{"T":"301","2":"Neferti","3":"I hope you... can get some... proper shuteye..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Haha, Neferti... Everyone's going on about work. You're the only one being kind."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"It's almost like you really remember me..."},{"T":"301","3":"Neferti is only holding a crude blade. He looks like his muscles are about to tear his clothes to shreds. But based on the damaged frame, he is just a simple, hollow shell."},{"T":"301","3":"Maybe he only has enough strength to lift that knife. What a joke."},{"T":"301","3":"Roland thinks a moment, then closes his eyes and takes a step toward his colleagues\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"\u2014But he is then pushed aside by a shadowy figure."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Rgh..."},{"T":"301","3":"Roland crashes into the wall, and his shoulders feel like a chunk is missing from them. But there is no doubt that he is still alive."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"...Mandy?"},{"T":"301","3":"Looking back, the mechanoid officer stands in his place. His side appears to be pierced by a sharp weapon, exposing his familiar mechanical insides."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Haha. Mandy, it's not like you to join the battlefield. But now that you're here, don't hold back..."},{"T":"301","2":"Mandhasti","3":"When a knight. In trouble. Is the King's duty. To help."},{"T":"301","2":"Mandhasti","3":"Remember... Memory. Health, Must. Preserve."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"...?"},{"T":"301","2":"Mandhasti","3":"Protect. Roland's. Everything."},{"T":"301","2":"Mandhasti","3":"Mandhasti's. Main. Objective."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Mandhasti","3":"Hurry. Run..."},{"T":"301","2":"Mandhasti","3":"My. Knight..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Hmph."},{"T":"301","3":"One step back, two steps back. Roland suddenly turns around and bumps into the shelf beside him. A shelf full of prop goods falls over, blocking the small hole."},{"T":"301","3":"He doesn't bother to check on the mechanoids behind him. Instead, he turns to run out of the other exit."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"R-run...?"},{"T":"301","3":"Where is he going? He doesn't know where in the park is still safe, nor if he could still survive this."},{"T":"301","3":"There is no direction, no goal, just running like a bat out of hell. Every step he takes, he wants to take back. Every time he accelerates, he feels something slow him down."},{"T":"301","3":"Roland does not even feel that he is running. He feels like he is just tormenting himself with the ultimate goal of exhausting every ounce remaining of his strength."},{"T":"301","3":"His legs gradually fill with the burn of lactic acid. Yet the pain clears up his sense of logic and reason."},{"T":"301","3":"The brief scene and fragmented sentences gradually come together to make sense in his head."},{"T":"301","3":"'Party A agrees to pay Party B a monthly...'"},{"T":"301","3":"'Party B acknowledges and promises that during the effective period of this contract, Party B shall not have any contact with Roland (hereby referred to as 'the Product').'"},{"T":"301","3":"'During the effective period of this contract, Party B shall not be involved in any matter concerning the Product.'"},{"T":"301","3":"'When necessary, Party B is obliged to provide corresponding materials for AI-simulated personality training to ensure the stability of the Product.'"},{"T":"301","3":"Under various terms, Party B's signature can be easily recognized even if he has not seen it for many years."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Dad... Mom... Rolmo..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"AI-simulated personality, holograms, voice changers... Imitating family members when speaking with them and playing recordings when necessary... It's too easy to fabricate the illusion of family. Real family members can also enjoy a life of leisure and watch all this on TV from a distance."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"I wonder if they got a good price out of me. Are their lives any better because of it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"What do they think when they watch my performance?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Hah... I'm sure they'd get a kick out of it."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"A knight? An actor? Or that so-called process of pursuing whatever that gives me a sense of really being alive?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"In the end, everything I pursued was a lie. Just a clown in makeup mocked and laughed at by others."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Good show... Jolly good show..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"How can you not laugh at such a wonderful performance?"},{"T":"301","3":"Roland laughs out loud and continues to run."},{"T":"301","3":"He does not know how long he has run. His steps begin to falter, and his arms seem to swing off his body..."},{"T":"301","3":"Breathing can no longer support the strenuous exercise. Each breath is like swallowing an inflated balloon. Every time he steps, the lactic acid makes his muscles feel like they're being pulled apart."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"(Gasps for breath)"},{"T":"301","3":"Finally, he stumbles and falls to the ground, too weak and exhausted to get up again."},{"T":"301","3":"He hears the rustling of mechanoids approach him from behind."}]
