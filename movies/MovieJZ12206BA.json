[{"T":"301","3":"It is late in the night. While Constructs are all equipped with night vision, the besieged soldiers still feel like danger is approaching out of their instinct."},{"T":"301","3":"Danger, subsequently, spreads anxiety..."},{"T":"301","2":"Construct Soldier","3":"Captain, did Lloyd really flee from battle...?"},{"T":"301","2":"Construct Captain","3":"Shut up! Lloyd will never betray us. He... must be trying to get us some reinforcements."},{"T":"301","3":"The Captain tells them off, but his voice is apparently faltering."},{"T":"301","2":"Injured Construct","3":"Captain! More Corrupted... in the east! They have come again."},{"T":"301","2":"Construct Captain","3":"Those of you who are still able to fight, grab your weapons and follow me... We must hold on until Lloyd comes back."},{"T":"301","3":"The soldiers mechanically pick up their weapons and follow the order. But they all know that this time, the hero may not return to save them."},{"T":"301","3":"Suddenly, a soldier's eyes widen as he sees real despair."},{"T":"301","2":"Construct Soldier","3":"Captain...! The Corrupted have crossed the traps on the other side of the woods. We are surrounded!"},{"T":"301","3":"One after another, the Corrupted appear from behind the bushes, completely encircling the Construct troops."},{"T":"301","2":"Injured Construct","3":"Aargh...!"},{"T":"301","3":"The Corrupted swarm to the injured soldier as she becomes their first target, leaving no time for the other Construct soldiers to help."},{"T":"301","2":"Corrupted","3":"Rargh!!!!!"},{"T":"301","3":"But just before they tear the soldier apart, a sharp spear pierces through the head of the Corrupted and impales it to the ground."},{"T":"301","3":"The rest of the Corrupted are slightly stunned. Even when they are only acting on instinct, they can still feel that the Construct in front of them is the biggest threat."},{"T":"301","2":"Injured Construct","3":"You are..."},{"T":"301","2":"Construct Captain","3":"It's 'Death'! Hurry, run away from her!"},{"T":"301","3":"The injured soldier quickly rolls away before Vera's banner spear thrusts toward her direction, narrowly grazing her face while piercing another Corrupted behind."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Oops, sorry. I almost mistook you for the Corrupted."},{"T":"301","3":"Vera pulls out her spear and tosses the Corrupted away, knocking back another Corrupted that is charging forward. When it tries to get up, Vera stomps its head to pieces."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Listen up! I've got good news for you. The Lloyd you are waiting for has fled from the battlefield. He is not coming back!"},{"T":"301","2":"Construct Captain","3":"'The Undying Loy' will never leave us behind...!"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Hah, 'Undying' my ***! Here, do you recognize this spear?"},{"T":"301","2":"Construct Soldier","3":"Captain! She's holding Lloyd's banner spear...!"},{"T":"301","2":"Construct Captain","3":"Why do you have his spear?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Because I was the one who killed him. This spear speaks for itself!"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"He was slightly smarter than you, but he made a wrong decision. If only he chose to die with you, I wouldn't have needed to kill him myself."},{"T":"301","2":"Construct Captain","3":"No way..."},{"T":"301","3":"The Corrupted are closing in once again. Vera looks at them with a playful grin."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"But it wouldn't make any difference. You are going to die here anyway..."},{"T":"301","3":"The Constructs know they stand no chance against such a vast number of Corrupted. No matter how hard they fight, they won't make it out of this siege."},{"T":"301","2":"Construct Soldier","3":"Lloyd is dead... We are doomed..."},{"T":"301","2":"Injured Construct","3":"Right, recall! Let's just recall so we can live! Just like Lloyd always did!"},{"T":"301","3":"As the soldiers begin to panic, their defense starts to falter. One soldier has completely lost the will to fight and abandoned his weapon, no longer reacting to the Corrupted's attack."},{"T":"301","3":"But just before the Corrupted's claws pierce through the soldier, it is impaled by Vera's banner spear."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Useless fools! Can't you do anything yourselves without Lloyd to rely on?!"},{"T":"301","3":"Vera raises the banner on her spear so everyone can see her and hear her voice."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"The fact that I killed him means I am stronger. I can do things that he cannot. My flag has not fallen, and my spear is still sharp!"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Look at you, cowards. How laughable! Only losers will put their hope on recalling. I can break through these weak Corrupted alone and return to Babylonia alive!"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"But if you, any of you, still have at least one bit of ego left in your faint-hearted mind, then follow his banner and march forward!"},{"T":"301","3":"Vera flips the banner spear wildly and cuts the Corrupted near her in half with one mighty swing. The encirclement suddenly has a small opening."},{"T":"301","2":"Construct Captain","3":"There's no way that Lloyd could lose to this arrogant bastard..."},{"T":"301","2":"Construct Soldier","3":"Captain... She must have caught Lloyd off-guard with her evil means!"},{"T":"301","2":"Injured Construct","3":"But..."},{"T":"301","3":"The injured Construct slowly stands up again, pulling out her worn blade."},{"T":"301","2":"Injured Construct","3":"She's right. She may actually get us out of here."},{"T":"301","2":"Construct Soldier","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Construct Captain","3":"Lloyd must still be alive..."},{"T":"301","2":"Construct Captain","3":"So grab your weapons! We can't let her look down on us!"},{"T":"301","3":"Many soldiers are still hesitating, but more have clenched their weapons. With their broken bodies, they launch a final charge following the waving banner."}]
