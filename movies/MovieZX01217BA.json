Before Chrome could identify the figure, Kamui has already realized that it was the Phecda they saved in the industrial zone."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"You are..."},{"T":"301","2":"Phecda A","3":"Constructs of Babylonia, pick up your weapons, quick."},{"T":"301","3":"The Phecda fires at Lamia as he speaks.
