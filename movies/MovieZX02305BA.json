We can all sing together."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"...I'll pass."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Hmm... I think the commandant wants to hear you sing."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"The music and hot porridge warm the hearts of the despondent crowd as they join in the chorus and clap along."},{"T":"301","3":"They find solace in the melancholic lyrics rather than rely on false hope."},{"T":"301","3":"They use the song to unload their grievances and shed tears, leaving only faint echoes of their cries."},{"T":"301","2":"Chuck","3":"See? What'd I say?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Chuck","3":"Playing music might not fix anything, but getting your feelings off your chest is better than holding them in."},{"T":"301","2":"Cali","3":"That song..."},{"T":"301","3":"Listening to the song, the old man's lips begin to tremble and his eyes brim with tears."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"What's wrong?"},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"He's fine. An old man like him... He's probably just thinking about the past."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"As people get older, some things become more clear, regardless of the song or a sack of rice..."},{"T":"301","3":"She shivers and lights a precious rolled cigarette as her eyes sink into memories."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"During the Golden Age, livestock and farmland were run by machines. After the meltdown of the zero-point reactor, food sources were cut off."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"After such a long time, it was difficult for people to take up farming and raising livestock, but some people managed to do it."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"Not many people were able to while also fighting the Corrupted. People talked about taking seeds back to find safe places to plant crops."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"But once there weren't any Corrupted, people desperate for food came to seize all of our hard work."},{"T":"301","3":"She raises her hardened gaze and looks around at the refugees sitting in the basement."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"Just like the great winter famine in the historical records, there was no stable yield of food for a long time. People could only take what they could get their hands on."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"Without livestock or produce, we resorted to eating birds and mice."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"People even scavenged in areas with hordes of Corrupted, but few returned."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"So people began to breed something that they could raise quickly and that others hated."},{"T":"301","3":"She takes out the half-remaining rolled cigarette and draws something about four centimeters in length with her hands. She doesn't say what it was, but everyone understands what she meant."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"But there wasn't much left to feed those pesky insects, so they couldn't raise enough to be made into protein blocks like the movies in the Golden Age."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"And, normally, people wouldn't have touched them. But worst came to worst, even those were taken."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"If this went unchecked, we would've filled our stomachs with everything and there wouldn't be anything left. So rules were made and spread through word of mouth..."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"Seeds must be left behind. Offspring and fish eggs are not to be eaten. Plant roots must remain in the soil. Pregnant animals and their food are not to be disturbed unless there is an emergency."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"Once people began to abide by these rules, we noticed some improvement. Animals could be seen in the mountains and forests, and seedlings sprout in areas that were harvested."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"It helped us get through our darkest time. The old folks who lived through that era still remember it."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"But the disaster didn't spare us. It only got worse every day... Sometimes people break the rules when they can longer take the hunger."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"And once the rules are broken, those that suffer have no choice but to do the same."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"That's when we met 'Cheese', heh... We didn't know his real name, but that's what he was eating when we saw him. Cheese was so rare at the time, that's what we decided to call him."},{"T":"301","3":"She takes a deep drag of her cigarette. Ash rolls down her fingers, but she doesn't seem to mind. She just sighs in the thick cloud of smoke."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"...Nothing I'm proud of."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"We thought he was well off seeing him eat cheese next to a field he lived by."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"That old geezer snuck into his field to steal food for us to eat, but didn't leave him any seeds. Cheese and his wife barely made it through the winter, but the baby in her belly didn't make it."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"The first time we heard this song was when he was kneeling in his empty field... holding his wife who had fainted from crying as he sang to her."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"We didn't have the heart to go up and confess what we had done. We sent him some supplies, but they moved away shortly after."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"Since then, we've had the habit of leaving seeds for everything we eat. Even if no one cares about this rule, we can't break it ourselves."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"Even though the conservation areas have already been built, there's still room to raise crops and livestock there."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"But as you all have seen, this stuff won't last very many days if anything bad happens."},{"T":"301","3":"She shakes her head, then snuffs out her cigarette."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"Well, enough of me rambling out these trifles of the past. The porridge should be ready now. Let's dig in."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Child","3":"Yeah!"},{"T":"301","3":"The refugees who already become too preoccupied with thoughts of the long-awaited porridge to listen to her story suddenly spring to life."},{"T":"301","3":"Surprised by excitement, the Constructs resting in the nearby room walk out."},{"T":"301","2":"Construct Soldier","3":"Let's start serving everyone."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Sure."},{"T":"301","2":"Construct Soldier","3":"Everyone, form a line. No need to push and shove."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Child","3":"Got it!"},{"T":"301","3":"Everyone grabs a spoon and lines up, holding their own tableware containers enthusiastically, paying extra attention that they receive their fair share."},{"T":"301","3":"Jin holds the porridge carefully, salutes the Construct Soldiers and Liv, then returns to Lindsey's bed."},{"T":"301","3":"Old Cali, having not eaten for three days, takes a bite out of his wife's porridge under her persuasion."},{"T":"301","3":"Stanley, Shrek, Fantine... Everyone except for the wounded who are still unconscious gets a bowl of warm porridge."},{"T":"301","3":"The heat from the bowl in their hands warms their spirit as people sit down and enjoy this rare delicacy."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Liv..."},{"T":"301","3":"While the crowd is distracted by their meal, Lucia calls Liv aside in a low voice."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Yes?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Come with me."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"..."}]
