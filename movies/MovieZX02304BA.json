Because my parents were just like you."},{"T":"301","2":"Stanley","3":"They had me without thinking about the future.

You have a child on the way.

My dad 'gave' me to another family for a bowl of porridge."},{"T":"301","2":"Stanley","3":"My adoptive father turned out to be just like him, too.

Sigh... Conservation areas just want children to survive, but who would've thought there'd be bastards like them."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee 5","3":"How are they bastards? Without them, who'd dare to have children in a world like this?"},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee 6","3":"They don't look into who the child belongs to and just give out supplies."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee 7","3":"How can they? And can you guarantee you'd be alive tomorrow? If someone's alive to take care of a child, that's all that matters."},{"T":"301","2":"Stanley","3":"...But have you ever thought about it? How can abandoned children survive on the side of the road?"},{"T":"301","2":"Stanley","3":"Being a burden on others, banished from conservation areas, and cursed at..."},{"T":"301","2":"Stanley","3":"So... I want to ask you, as a parent, why would you have a child if you can't take care of them?"},{"T":"301","2":"Stanley","3":"Are you just looking for short-term benefits? Or is it because you don't care about your child's future?"},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Woman","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"She hangs her head in silence, unable to come up with an answer.

Our profession is much more dangerous now, but some are still willing to take the risk."},{"T":"301","2":"Familiar Man","3":"Half of the supplies belonged to her husband... And I can't go eating someone else's food, now can I?"},{"T":"301","3":"Stanley's eyes widen at the unexpected answer."},{"T":"301","2":"Stanley","3":"S-sorry. I didn't realize..."},{"T":"301","2":"Stanley","3":"I'm really sorry... I shouldn't have misjudged you and spoken out of turn."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Woman","3":"It's okay. It really is a serious issue."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Woman","3":"We aren't his parents, but I heard him say that he had a similar experience as your own. His biological parents died in an accident two years ago when he was only eight years old."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Woman","3":"None of us can be sure that we'll live to see tomorrow in this cruel world, let alone stay together with our children."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Woman","3":"And, of course, we can't guarantee a safe upbringing for our children..."},{"T":"301","2":"Stanley","3":"Okay..."},{"T":"301","3":"She slowly walks up and sits down next to Stanley, then gently pats him on the back with one hand and rubs Matches' fluffy head with the other."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Woman","3":"...It's so hard for children to even just stay alive when they're separated from their parents at such a young age..."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Woman","3":"I will consider what you said carefully and be sure to make the right decision..."},{"T":"301","2":"Stanley","3":"...Okay."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee 7","3":"(Sighs) Enough with this crap. Isn't it obvious? If you have a child, you should raise them. Everyone is faced with hardship in this cruel world. We're all equal here. No point in complaining."},{"T":"301","2":"Stanley","3":"...Sorry."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Woman","3":"No need to apologize."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Woman","3":"The world is full of injustice."},{"T":"301","3":"She looks at everyone, then slowly closes her eyes."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Woman","3":"We're all struggling with the same adversities, but some people are armed and some people can move freely. Others... carry lives yet to be born and others are forced to run before they can walk."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Woman","3":"It's amazing if you can survive in this world and save another life."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee 7","3":"Alright, it's my fault. I just don't want to see everyone looking down in the dumps. It's hard enough to have a new born life only to get kicked back."},{"T":"301","3":"He turns his back to the refugee woman and Stanley with a little indignation."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee 8","3":"You shouldn't downtrod on others just because you've been down on your luck."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"Just like how one shouldn't suppress their sadness, the hope that still exists in the crowd should never be taken away."},{"T":"301","3":"No matter which side of the debate, each has its own reasons."},{"T":"301","2":"Stanley","3":"But..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Stanley, I know what you're worried about..."},{"T":"301","3":"Liv sews up the crying child's wound and wraps him in a blanket, then stands up with her hand on the edge of the cot."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"The arrival of a new life should be a joyful thing, but we don't want to give each other a burden beyond our means."},{"T":"301","2":"Stanley","3":"...You're right."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Even still... This difficulty can also be rewarding."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"By that, I don't just mean getting supplies using the kindness of others, but hope and dependence."},{"T":"301","3":"Liv looks down at Matches next to Stanley and smiles quietly."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Did you choose to take care of Matches because you think he'll help you get supplies?"},{"T":"301","2":"Stanley","3":"No."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"But by doing so, your life has become more difficult and has made your food even more scarce."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"But as you said, he gives your life meaning and motivation. That's why you made the choice... Right?"},{"T":"301","2":"Stanley","3":"...Yeah."},{"T":"301","3":"He nods and looks at the woman beside him apologetically."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Well, then... How do you view this child?"},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Woman","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"She lowers her head in silent contemplation."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee 8","3":"You should still have the baby. We're barely making it through each day and we don't have enough to eat, but it's also sad to see someone die."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee 8","3":"If there are only a few living people left in this land, what good are more supplies? This world won't be so lonely with more lives around."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee 7","3":"Yeah! That's what I mean."},{"T":"301","3":"Hearing this, he immediately turns around excitedly and claps his hands."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee 7","3":"Whether it's a person or a dog, you need to protect them as their mom. You can't be so quick to give up... Ugh, there I go running my mouth again..."},{"T":"301","3":"He gently pats himself on the face in apology. Stanley and the woman in the crowd laugh at his 'motherly instinct' kicking in."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee 7","3":"Sorry, I've never been too good at talking with others."},{"T":"301","3":"He rubs his hands with a kind smile. The dust from his hands causes him to sneeze a couple of times."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee 7","3":"Well, since you're already here, how about changing the subject? What's your name? Where did you come from? How's the situation outside?"},{"T":"301","3":"Every new refugee always gets asked, 'Where did you come from' and 'what's the situation outside'. So much so, they've become the standard greeting. Even if they don't answer at first, they will be asked in private."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Woman","3":"My name is Fantine. I came from City 045 in the south. I was originally going to City 044's conservation area, but then there was a problem with the CPF."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"What's wrong with City 045 and 044?"},{"T":"301","2":"Fantine","3":"The conservation area in City 045 is full and something's wrong with City 044's CPF, for which I was stopped by a Construct on my way there."},{"T":"301","2":"Fantine","3":"He said that a horde of Hetero-Creatures attacked the conservation area and the CPF, so they're evacuating the residents."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"...City 044. That's where Lucia and Lee are."},{"T":"301","3":"Hearing this, the refugees begin to whisper amongst each other."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee 4","3":"I thought it would be safest to the south. Looks like it's just more of the same suffering. There may not be those twins, but there are just as many Hetero-Creatures!"},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee 5","3":"Guess it's not safe here anymore. We need to evacuate ASAP!"},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"Evacuate? Where else is there to go?"},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"Are there any safe places left out there?"},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee 6","3":"Then what else should we do?"},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"If Babylonia doesn't send any more support, what about the Forsaken?"},{"T":"301","2":"Fantine","3":"The Forsaken..."},{"T":"301","2":"Fantine","3":"Actually, this gentleman came from the Forsaken."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"Oh? You know the Forsaken? How's the situation over there?"},{"T":"301","2":"Familiar Man","3":"I don't know them too well, but I've done business with them as a merchant."},{"T":"301","2":"Familiar Man","3":"They're still sheltering refugees, but every base is already overcrowded."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"...Looks like we need to think about evacuating."},{"T":"301","2":"Familiar Man","3":"They're still in a better position than most conservation areas. At least they have food reserves. But given this environment, they're in desperate need of serum."},{"T":"301","2":"Familiar Man","3":"I came here to see if I could find any spare serum in the conservation areas to exchange with them."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"...Exchange?"},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"You mentioned her husband is also a merchant. What about him?"},{"T":"301","2":"Fantine","3":"He fell into the Red Tide while protecting me... The last I heard his voice, he was already..."},{"T":"301","2":"Fantine","3":"I know he isn't alive anymore, but the Hetero-Sapien sounded just like him..."},{"T":"301","2":"Fantine","3":"If this gentleman hadn't come here to pick up goods, I would have been... torn to pieces by those Hetero-Sapiens."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"Seems like you've had your fair share of experience with those monsters."},{"T":"301","3":"The old lady nods in recognition."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"What's your name, young man?"},{"T":"301","2":"Familiar Man","3":"My name's Shrek."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Shrek...?"},{"T":"301","3":"Hearing this name, Liv finally realizes why the man seemed so familiar."},{"T":"301","3":"The first time she heard this name was before they encountered the Polyphage."},{"T":"301","3":"Gray Raven had received a new mission that required them to search the coordinates left by Huaxu in the 'Deserted Ruins'.
