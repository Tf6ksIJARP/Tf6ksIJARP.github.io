Even the 'Chariot'..."},{"T":"301","3":"'Gear' waves its arms and deflects a bullet. Right as it is about to shoot back, it feels a gust of wind above him."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"TAKE THIS!"},{"T":"301","3":"Kamui raises his greatsword and slashes downward from high above as 'Gear' retreats. The devastating slash strikes the ground, sending debris flying into the air."},{"T":"301","3":"'Gear' shoulders the blow of debris, then reaches out to grab Kamui through the cloud of dust,"},{"T":"301","3":"But as 'Gear' traverses the dust, it is met with a scythe imbued with lightning."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"One cannot catch Saint Elmo's Fire barehanded."},{"T":"301","3":"Retreating a few steps, 'Gear' manages to stabilize itself and catch the destructive impact of the scythe.

Can't block this now, can you?!"},{"T":"301","3":"The greatsword slices through the lightning and bullets, straight for 'Gear's' head. Following a dull thud, the strike sends 'Gear' flying across the street and into a building."},{"T":"301","2":"Gear?","3":"Is that all you've got?"},{"T":"301","3":"After pushing off the stone slab that pinned it down, 'Gear' slowly exits the building. A faint current envelopes it. The slash from the greatsword should have smashed its frame. Instead, it only leaves a faint scratch on its helmet."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Looks like we're back to where we started."},{"T":"301","3":"'Gear' looks around to discover that the trio have pushed it back to where Wanshi first made his retreat."},{"T":"301","2":"Gear?","3":"Hmph, it appears so. We're back to where you wretched dogs ran away with your tails between your legs."},{"T":"301","2":"Gear?","3":"How sad.
