[{"T":"301","2":"Guard","3":"Sir, this is Rosetta, the one under observation."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Waking up to find myself in a cell... What are you people up to?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"I want you to join us in this battle, Rosetta."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"You're keeping me in the dark for how I got here, huh..."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"We told the Forest Guard that you have a better chance of recovery here, and look. That's exactly how it turned out. If you stayed in that dump, you'd probably still be in a coma."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Coma... So what happened... after Alpha?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"You can check the reports later. I have no obligation to explain this to you. So will you join the battle, Rosetta?"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Where, and against whom?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Kowloong Corp. The Ascendants are the enemy. Also, the Forest Guards are heading there too."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Diana and the others? Why..."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"I can't give you a satisfactory answer. I come here, only for your strength."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Although you're not as good as the Ascendants, you can still hold them in place for us. Use yourself for Babylonia."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"This is why I had you, a 'sinner,' given special treatment in Babylonia."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"...My weapons."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Centaur-type modules are not Babylonia tech, so we can only give you temporarily manufactured spears. Take on as many enemies as you can. Nod if you understand."},{"T":"301","3":"And so Rosetta nods."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Release her."},{"T":"301","3":"The guard follows Nikola's command and opens the cell wall. The instant Rosetta is free, she grabs Nikola by the throat with one hand, too fast for the guards to react."},{"T":"301","2":"Guard","3":"You!"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"You are Nikola, correct? Get this right in your head. I am not fighting for Babylonia."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"I'm fighting for those who've helped me."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Pah... Whatever you like."},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"Rosetta... Is that you, Rosetta...?"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"...It's me, Diana."},{"T":"301","3":"A familiar figure blocks Alpha's blade\u2014Rosetta. As if in replay of their first meeting, Rosetta is clutching her javelin and shield, glaring at the upright Alpha."},{"T":"301","2":"\u03b1","3":"To actually go so far... What did Babylonia do to you? Memory tampering, or are you a copy?"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"I am me myself, Alpha."},{"T":"301","3":"Seeing the two, Diana is suddenly reminded of the past. The regret of not being there for Rosetta lingers deep in the recesses of her mind. So instead of doing as Rosetta said in the Arctic, she shuffles closer to her."},{"T":"301","3":"The other Forest Guards seem to have the same thoughts. To them, the collective is always the highest priority."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Don't!"},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"...Why?"},{"T":"301","3":"At Rosetta's shout, Diana notices the golden particles floating around her, unknown, unforeseen, but no less frightening."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"I'll stop Alpha here and the one behind her. You go lend support in other parts. We have different duties."},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"...Forest Guards, with me!"},{"T":"301","2":"Forest Guard Member","3":"Roger!"},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"Sister, is it okay to let them go?"},{"T":"301","2":"\u03b1","3":"I would have. But that'd be putting me on the bench. You lot sure know how to ruin someone's day."},{"T":"301","2":"\u03b1","3":"Are you prepared to pay the price?"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"You can even keep the change... Nikola, are those 'things' ready?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"We don't have much of them, but you've led a team before. You know how best to use them."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Stop wasting words. Hand their control over."},{"T":"301","2":"\u03b1","3":"You done with the call? Then give your girl some attention, Rosetta."}]
