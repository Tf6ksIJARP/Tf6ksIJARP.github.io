Some looked like open roads, but there were invisible barriers."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"It's easier this way. When Kamui was playing games, I often wanted to stop him from doing all those repetitive side quests."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Like the errand quests you talked about?"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Some were even refreshed on a daily basis. I mean, they were all single player games, so what was the point of these boring tasks? What were those designers thinking?"},{"T":"301","2":"Karenina","3":"They just wanted to keep the players occupied, I guess."},{"T":"301","3":"Talking like real game designers, the trio completely ignored the traps in the castle and continued walking forward."},{"T":"301","3":"Not like they could easily find where the traps were."},{"T":"301","3":"They didn't even care if the traps were triggered or not."},{"T":"301","3":"According to Camu, this was called 'HP management', which was often used by Kamui when he played games."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"In RPGs, traps usually do not kill the player instantly.
