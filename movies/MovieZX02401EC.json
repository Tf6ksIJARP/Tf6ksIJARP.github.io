Simply put, it's the invisible wall that separates the actors from the audience in a play. 'Breaking that fourth wall' means you remove the veil between reality and the play, and it has became a new genre of theatre since realism became a thing."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"I guess you are the Chief for a reason."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"The way Hamlet works is basically treating tragedies as the 'best solutions.' That is exactly why even though Selena wrote more than just one ending, the script will always draw to a tragic ending."},{"T":"302","2":"Is this one of the reasons why that machine is called Hamlet?","4":"Is it possible for it to alter the data of theater play?"},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"I think that is possible. After all, Hamlet was considered one of the Four Tragedies by Shakespeare back in the Golden Age."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"Hamlet doesn't have the ability to do that. It operates based on the processing of source data added by real humans and doesn't deviate from that because it is encoded like DNAs."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"So, as a performer in the play, you helped the non-tragic ending make more sense using the characters' reasonable actions and broke the fourth wall in the process. That was why Hamlet showed up during the play."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"This doesn't come as a surprise considering that method is already encoded..."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"Anyway... the evil dragon has been defeated. And both the champion and the piper survived, right?"},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"And the piper embarked on her journey in the end, right?"},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"I prefer this ending to the previous ones."},{"T":"302","2":"Me too.","4":"I would say embarking on a journey alone is too lonely."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"Don't you think the piper is too lonely if she has to go on that journey alone?"},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"...I think so too."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"...But at least she survived. Well, everyone survived."},{"T":"302","2":"Yeah.","4":"There is always hope so long as we live."},{"T":"301","3":"Ayla lets out a sigh. She keeps her emotional feelings under control and changes to another subject."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"We have triggered three endings so far... but I don't think this will be the last one."},{"T":"302","2":"I think it is the last one.","4":"I agree with you."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"Do you think these are all the messages Selena left behind...? Are we not... missing anything else?"},{"T":"302","2":"The sailor in the story mentioned a traveler."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"Why?"},{"T":"302","2":"I think the story is missing something.","4":"Tell her about the details that trouble you."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"Do you mean the traveler with purple eyes?"},{"T":"302","2":"I think she is the same person as the piper."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"...Perhaps all these characters are trying to tell us Selena decided to become the piper because of the journey."},{"T":"302","2":"What about the siren's call that sailor mentioned?"},{"T":"302","2":"Wanshi."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Hmm?"},{"T":"302","2":"What do you think of this sound?"},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"You think it sounds like a whale song, but the refugees call it the 'siren's call.'"},{"T":"302","2":"'Siren's call'?"},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Documents leftover from the Golden Age say that sirens were monsters that lived in the ocean who lured sailors with songs."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Sailors would become entranced by their songs and crash their ships into the reefs."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"It's not difficult to understand why it's garnered such a negative reputation. After all, the sound and Red Tide coincide with death."},{"T":"302","2":"But..."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"...It is. It's bound to the Red Tide, so we can always rely on the sound to predict the rise and fall of the Red Tide."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Ironically, it isn't so much an alluring sound that puts people in a trance, but rather... It seems to be a reminder of the approaching Red Tide."},{"T":"301","3":"..."},{"T":"302","2":"What's that?"},{"T":"301","3":"The question seems to rouse the monster in the middle of the Red Tide.

The tranquil Red Tide seems to suddenly take on life as it gradually inundates the surrounding land."},{"T":"301","3":"You recall the memories of Operation Red Tide."},{"T":"301","3":"The source of that Siren's call in the memories and the horrible monsters is the writer of this play."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"...!"},{"T":"302","2":"That is too coincidental to be true."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"Do you remember the melody?"},{"T":"302","2":"I heard the sailor sing it.","4":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"The melody still lingers in your mind."},{"T":"301","3":"You focus on recalling the melody."},{"T":"301","3":"Memories flash before you."},{"T":"301","3":"A memory fragment comes to mind."},{"T":"301","3":"Ayla activates the terminal."},{"T":"301","3":"You hear someone singing an adagio aria."},{"T":"301","3":"This is the most beautiful sound you have ever heard."},{"T":"301","3":"The tone ebbs and flows as it rises higher. Suddenly, a vast ocean seems to appear before your very eyes."},{"T":"301","3":"The female singer is not fully imitating the sound of a real whale, but she conveys the same expression in the melody."},{"T":"301","3":"\u2014A lonely blue whale is swinging its tail fin and cruising in the sea. Again and again it sings, its song echoing throughout the ocean depths, but there is no response."},{"T":"301","3":"The singing stopped, but the song had no ending, because the lonely whale never found its herd."},{"T":"302","2":"Sounds like the song isn't finished."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"You're right."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"She said that she hadn't thought of an ending yet because she hasn't seen the ocean with her own eyes."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"She'll write the second half of the song when she sees the real ocean."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"That's what she said at least."},{"T":"301","3":"As the tune comes to an end, things become clearer."},{"T":"301","3":"It is the second half of the soothing aria. It is the joy of a lonely whale drowning in the depth of the ocean that finally finds where it belongs.
