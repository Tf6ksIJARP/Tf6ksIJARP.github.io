[{"T":"301","3":"City 173, outside the Holy Church - Nov 3rd, 10:29 AM"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Hey, Lofte. You on patrol duty today? What are you looking at outside the church?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lofte","3":"Oh hi, Toby. Yeah, I got thrown all the patrol missions ever since you took time off to nurse your injuries."},{"T":"301","2":"Toby","3":"Wow, sorry for the extra work, haha. Here, something for your hard work."},{"T":"301","3":"Toby throws a pack of MRE rations at Lofte."},{"T":"301","2":"Lofte","3":"Oh come off it, you. Are those provisions for the church?"},{"T":"301","2":"Toby","3":"Haha, you got me."},{"T":"301","2":"Lofte","3":"Sigh, that old man Kaif, always asking you to help with deliveries. It's fine when you were healthy but how can your wounds heal now!"},{"T":"301","2":"Toby","3":"Nah, I just treat it as rehabilitation."},{"T":"301","2":"Toby","3":"Enough about me, I remember today is not a holy day, why's the church so noisy?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lofte","3":"It's been like that ever since that sister came to this church."},{"T":"301","2":"Toby","3":"Nun?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lofte","3":"Yeah, an army from Kuzath Snow Plain stopped by a while ago, they left a sister here and continued down south with the other survivors."},{"T":"301","2":"Toby","3":"Oh, I remember them. Their leader looked tough. I wonder if my arrows are faster than his blades, hehe."},{"T":"301","3":"Having said that, Toby raises his left arm to chest level with the supply crate in hand, while making a drawing motion with his right hand, aiming for a point beyond the horizon and mimicking the sounds of shooting arrows himself."},{"T":"301","2":"Lofte","3":"Can't you just take it easy for a day..."},{"T":"301","2":"Toby","3":"How can I protect you all if I don't train constantly?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lofte","3":"Alright, alright, let me continue. That sister... I think she's called Bianca?"},{"T":"301","2":"Toby","3":"Bianca... I've been hearing that name quite a lot recently."},{"T":"301","3":"Toby stops making shooting motions and recalls some recent conversations he had overheard."},{"T":"301","2":"Sister A","3":"Did you hear? That newcomer got into quite a lot of trouble and everyone was afraid of her, so she got abandoned here at our church."},{"T":"301","2":"Sister B","3":"...I heard she killed the father who raised her up."},{"T":"301","2":"Sister C","3":"Oh my Lord!"},{"T":"301","2":"Sister A","3":"I can't believe a church raised a sister like that, no, more like a 'witch'..."},{"T":"301","2":"Sister C","3":"Hmph, she didn't even deny it when asked, she's definitely guilty if you ask me."},{"T":"301","2":"Sister B","3":"Ahem, someone's coming over."},{"T":"301","2":"Toby","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Citizen A","3":"Sigh, there've been disappearances more and more lately, even that homeless old man's gone."},{"T":"301","2":"Citizen B","3":"Speaking of him, I remember seeing him with that new sister from the church before, you don't think..."},{"T":"301","2":"Citizen A","3":"I think you're on to something here. Come to think of it, we started seeing more people going missing after that Bianca came here."},{"T":"301","2":"Citizen B","3":"Then it must've been her! We should chase her out of town and then we'll be safe."},{"T":"301","2":"Citizen A","3":"I know, right? It's so obvious but those soldiers are still doing nothing! Why are we paying taxes to feed those slackers?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Citizen B","3":"Who in their right mind would want to become a soldier anyway if not for the current situation? Except for Toby, that kid's an exception."},{"T":"301","2":"Citizen A","3":"Yeah, good kids like him are rare to come by nowadays."},{"T":"301","2":"Citizen B","3":"Shh, she's coming over, let's go."},{"T":"301","2":"Toby","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lofte","3":"I heard she killed the father who raised her on the snow plains."},{"T":"301","3":"Toby is pulled back to reality by Lofte's voice. Following Lofte's gaze, he sees a blond girl sitting in a corner all by herself."},{"T":"301","2":"Toby","3":"Yeah... but I think she's just misunderstood. She may look cold, but I don't think she's a bad person."},{"T":"301","2":"Lofte","3":"Ha, only you would think that."},{"T":"301","3":"Toby waves at Bianca passionately, catching the attention of those in the church."},{"T":"301","2":"Lofte","3":"Welp, it's time for guard duty so I'll see you later. Though I suggest you keep your distance from her."},{"T":"301","3":"Before Toby could reply, the crowd that has caught sight of Toby swarmed over."},{"T":"301","2":"Father Leon","3":"Toby!"},{"T":"301","2":"Toby","3":"Good afternoon, Father Leon. Here's the provisions for this week."},{"T":"301","3":"Toby places the supply crate on the ground and taps on the monitor of the crate a few times."},{"T":"301","3":"The supply crate opens up on all four sides, revealing the supplies inside."},{"T":"301","2":"Father Leon","3":"Thank you, Toby. Looks like Kaif's being lazy again. But I heard you were recovering from your injuries, why are you out here working?"},{"T":"301","2":"Toby","3":"They're pretty much healed already, but thanks for asking, Father."},{"T":"301","2":"Citizen B","3":"Long time no see, Toby! Heard you got hurt in the last battle, you've got us worried sick."},{"T":"301","2":"Toby","3":"I'm fine, I'm fine. 'Tis but a scratch. Look, I'm healthy as a horse!"},{"T":"301","3":"Toby runs his fingers through his brilliant blond hair while his right hand reaches for his bow on his back. He then poses in a way which he thought looks cool, causing the bystanders to laugh, consequently lifting the mood."},{"T":"301","2":"Father Leon","3":"We're all happy that you've recovered. All right, we shan't hold you up. Come, there's a supply pack for everyone."},{"T":"301","3":"The father claps his hands and the people gathered around Toby swiftly form a line."},{"T":"301","3":"Everyone prays in front of the supply crate before taking their own share. The whole process proceeds without a hitch."},{"T":"301","3":"Toby notices that Bianca stood at the end of the line the whole time with no intention to come forward and claim her supplies, so he takes out a supply pack from the crate and heads over to Bianca."},{"T":"301","2":"Toby","3":"Hey there, are you feeling unwell? Here's your share of the provisions."},{"T":"301","2":"Toby","3":"Also, here's a flower for a lovely lady like you."},{"T":"301","3":"Toby holds out the supply pack to Bianca, and on top of the pack lies a single white lily."},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"No, thank you. Though I do appreciate the thought."},{"T":"301","2":"Toby","3":"What? But you'll starve! That..."},{"T":"301","3":"Before Toby could finish his sentence, a woman inserts herself between them, putting a stop to the conversation."},{"T":"301","2":"Sister A","3":"Toby, don't mind her. She said she doesn't need it so just leave her."},{"T":"301","2":"Father Leon","3":"You, where are your manners?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Citizen C","3":"Yeah! Come over here, Toby, don't mind her."},{"T":"301","2":"Toby","3":"Wha? It's fine, I..."},{"T":"301","2":"Citizen C","3":"Sorry about her, Toby. She's always like this. You should just stay away from her. Oh right, I heard there have been disappearances nearby here lately too."},{"T":"301","2":"Citizen B","3":"It's getting more and more worrisome, you should be careful too."},{"T":"301","3":"With everyone's attention on him, Toby cannot continue his conversation with Bianca. Instead, he addresses the crowd."},{"T":"301","2":"Toby","3":"Don't worry, I'll protect each and every one of you! It's my duty as a soldier after all!"}]
