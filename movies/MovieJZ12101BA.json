Whisper in my ear, baby.' playing through the speaker. It only plays this one line; no more, no less."},{"T":"301","3":"At 7 o'clock, she finishes washing up and is spared a brief moment of silence."},{"T":"301","3":"At this time, she normally just sits on the only chair in the room, waiting for her designated Medic Bot to administer her routine physical and injections."},{"T":"301","3":"She looks at the white Medic Bot in silence. The Medic Bot will flash one of three colors depending on her examination results. Green means 'Safe', orange means 'Standby', and red means 'Danger'."},{"T":"301","3":"These colors were the only colors she could see in the pure white confines of the room, thereby making the Medic Bot seem all the more peculiar."},{"T":"301","2":"Medic Bot","3":"...Ding!"},{"T":"301","3":"Today, the color is green. She is free to leave."},{"T":"301","3":"The holo-screen displays her schedule for the day. But does it really matter? Each day is merely a repetition of the previous day\u2014the same schedule she has seen countless times."},{"T":"301","3":"At 8 o'clock, staff at the research institute begin their work. No. 21's room is at the end of the corridor, so few people pass by the glass wall. She watches the staff clad in white lab coats, awaiting the one assigned to her room."},{"T":"301","3":"At 8:30, she hears the locking mechanism activate and the massive white door slide open. A staff member in a white lab coat walks in."},{"T":"301","2":"Staff Member","3":"Good morning, No. 21."},{"T":"301","3":"The staff member approaches the Medic Bot and inspects No. 21's vitals for the day."},{"T":"301","2":"Staff Member","3":"Looks like vitals are normal today."},{"T":"301","2":"No. 21","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Staff Member","3":"I have some news for you.

Why?"},{"T":"301","3":"Her response catches the staff member off guard. No. 21 normally just obeys quietly."},{"T":"301","2":"Staff Member","3":"Test Subject No. 20 had some... Um, forget it. It has nothing to do with you."},{"T":"301","3":"She stops herself mid-sentence, realizing she should not say too much. Instead, the staff member just replies vaguely."},{"T":"301","2":"Staff Member","3":"Put this on. You need to complete your daily training first."},{"T":"301","2":"No. 21","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"No. 21","3":"Understood."},{"T":"301","3":"The staff member hands her a collar.

When the collar turns bright red, she experiences severe pain and numbness radiating from it."},{"T":"301","3":"No. 21 has worn this ever since she was a child.

Do you know how old you are?"},{"T":"301","2":"No. 21","3":"...No."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"I know how old I am! The last time they gave me the Tanta... ta-whatever affinity test, I snuck a peek at the report the doctor was holding. According to the date, I should be fourteen years old!"},{"T":"301","2":"No. 21","3":"Okay..."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"But you've been here at the institute longer than me.

You have a Medic Bot unlike the others. Is it because of your poor health?"},{"T":"301","2":"No. 21","3":"(Nods) ...I haven't passed."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"That's okay! I saw your recent training results. You killed it! I wanna be strong like you... Once we're modded, we can get the heck outta here!"},{"T":"301","2":"No. 21","3":"...Leave? Here?"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Yup! No. 13 left last week after he completed his modification surgery. I heard some grown-ups say he's already going on missions."},{"T":"301","2":"No. 21","3":"Oh..."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"What's wrong? You don't wanna stay here, do you?"},{"T":"301","2":"No. 21","3":"I don't know. Is there any difference between doing experiments out there and here?"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Obviously, DUH! I saw the outside world before I was brought in. It's completely different from here... Er... It's hard to describe, though. It's been so long, I can't really remember... BUT! I'm sure it'll blow your mind when you see it!"},{"T":"301","3":"No. 20 sits cross-legged in front of No. 21.

But based on our numbers, looks like I'll be modded before you. When I get out, I'll be waiting for you!"},{"T":"301","2":"No. 21","3":"Why do you want to wait for me?"},{"T":"301","2":"No. 20","3":"Because... we're friends, silly!"},{"T":"301","2":"No. 21","3":"Friends?"},{"T":"301","2":"No. 20","3":"Sigh. The other kids are just as scatterbrained as you, but you're the only one that doesn't get mad at me. And besides, don't we talk a lot? I think that makes us friends."},{"T":"301","2":"No. 21","3":"I don't understand."},{"T":"301","2":"No. 20","3":"Let's make a pact. You're my first friend, and I'm your first friend. How does that sound?"},{"T":"301","3":"She ignores No. 21's confusion and continues to speak her mind, but No. 21 is used to it. Based on her analysis, No. 20 is safe and non-threatening. Not to mention, no one ever talks to No. 21 besides her. So, she nods in agreement."},{"T":"301","2":"No. 21","3":"Okay."},{"T":"301","2":"No. 20","3":"Awesome!"},{"T":"301","3":"No. 20 jumps on her in excitement and rubs her hair.

They found out I'm missing."},{"T":"301","2":"No. 21","3":"...Is your collar getting hot?"},{"T":"301","2":"No. 20","3":"Ouuuch... Ow! Ow! Ow! I need to get going!"},{"T":"301","3":"The girl staggers to her feet, puts her hand over the restraint collar on her neck, and spits her tongue out at No. 21 even though the pain causes her to wince slightly."},{"T":"301","3":"Following that, she runs away and disappears out of sight."},{"T":"301","3":"Once we're modded, we can leave?"},{"T":"301","3":"The thought of this does not get No. 21's hopes up."},{"T":"301","3":"Born as a test subject, her duty is to undergo experimentation, fight in combat training, and wait for the next experiment. Her future is like the list on the holo-screen in her room, written out long ago."},{"T":"301","3":"On the other hand... perhaps, there are many colors for her to see in the outside world."},{"T":"301","3":"That is all she wants to know."},{"T":"301","3":"She holds on to that desire as she falls into a deep sleep."},{"T":"301","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Your GPS shows that you've reached the target coordinates.

I'll leave you to your mission. Call me when necessary and keep in touch."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Still remember our objective? Recover the research material and core data..."},{"T":"301","2":"??","3":"Any more of your crap, and I'll hang my receiver next to one of the Daedalus Institute's loudspeakers so you can test out the surround sound in high fidelity."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Just recover the target without making a scene and I'm sure you can do it and just call me if you need anything and I'll be on standby and bye."},{"T":"301","3":"With a click as the transmission ends, the dark corridor returns to silence."},{"T":"301","2":"??","3":"...Hmph.

The effects of anesthesia still have not subsided, causing her to feel dizzy. After several attempts to raise her hand, she finally manages to pull off the respirator covering her face."},{"T":"301","3":"Taking off the respirator obstructing her vision, she sees a hand\u2014a robotic hand. Surprised by the unfamiliar sight, she tries to move her fingers, and the doll-like spherical joints move."},{"T":"301","3":"This is her body. She strains herself to look down, gasping for breath from the unprecedented confusion and panic."},{"T":"301","3":"Her body has become a mechanical frame\u2014but it is not complete. She can see her joints... Her legs are embedded with iron plates, with gaps between them, revealing the internal structure of thin wires and luminous chips."},{"T":"301","3":"No. 21 gradually relaxes her breathing\u2014before realizing that she no longer needs to breathe."},{"T":"301","2":"Medic Bot","3":"WARNING: Vital fluid leak. Please repair the intravenous tube promptly and complete the surgical procedure\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"The blinding red light on the Medic Bot indicates 'Danger'."},{"T":"301","3":"No. 21 feels her life leaving her body.

Patient must not leave the operating table. Repeat. Surgery incomplete. Patient must not leave the operating table."},{"T":"301","3":"The Medic Bot delivers an ear-splitting alert. Connected via a protruding tube, the Medic Bot is giving No. 21 a continuous flow of vital fluid and electricity."},{"T":"301","3":"However, No. 21 does not stop. One by one, the wires connected to her begin to sever. Her metal frame drags across the floor, making a sharp grating sound, as shards of glass scratch at her frame."},{"T":"301","3":"The Medic Bot is pulled closely behind by the tube connecting it to No. 21, constantly issuing warnings."},{"T":"301","3":"Ngh... Rgh..."},{"T":"301","3":"No. 21 has endured pain countless times, but that type of pain pales in comparison to what she is experiencing now."},{"T":"301","3":"She trembles violently. Her elbow slips out from under her on a pool of blood, causing her frame to fall onto the cold floor with a heavy thud.

Her heartbeat becomes languid and cumbersome."},{"T":"301","3":"Thump\u2014Thump\u2014Thump\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"BOOM!"},{"T":"301","3":"Following the deafening noise, No. 21 realizes that the sound was not coming from her heart.

Quit lecturing me."},{"T":"301","3":"She lowers her head and looks at No. 21's outstretched hand. Her expression remains unflinching."},{"T":"301","2":"??","3":"Tsk. Enough."},{"T":"301","3":"She furrows her brows and terminates the transmission."},{"T":"301","3":"She walks around No. 21 and proceeds down the corridor all without even casting so much as a sideways glance at her."},{"T":"301","2":"No. 21","3":"Don't... leave... me..."},{"T":"301","2":"No. 21","3":"I..."},{"T":"301","3":"No. 21's weak plea goes unanswered."},{"T":"301","3":"She slowly lowers her arm, unable to support her cumbersome mechanoid frame as her vision gradually fades to black."},{"T":"301","3":"Wind... Warm light... Birds chirping..."},{"T":"301","3":"The outside world is just a few steps away, but she no longer has the strength to make it."},{"T":"301","3":"After who knows how long, she hears the crisp sound of footsteps coming from behind..."},{"T":"301","2":"??","3":"...Is that all I could grab?"},{"T":"301","2":"??","3":"Not satisfied with my work?

How'd you..."},{"T":"301","3":"She terminates the transmission, stopping the babbling noise."},{"T":"301","3":"Right at that moment, the Medic Bot's last bar of energy depletes. The tube connecting it with No. 21 convulses, no longer injecting any fluid."},{"T":"301","3":"In a blur of consciousness, No. 21 feels a pair of hands lifting her shoulders."},{"T":"301","3":"She struggles to open her eyes.
