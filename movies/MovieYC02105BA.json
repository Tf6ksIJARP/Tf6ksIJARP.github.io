[{"T":"301","3":"Lamia knows she is different from the others."},{"T":"301","3":"She is scared of death, pain and hunger. In fact, she fears everything. She is always full of emotions.

The books and notes on his desk stack like a mountain."},{"T":"301","3":"Lamia has a deep impression on him because he has been taking care of her for a long time."},{"T":"301","3":"Maybe 'feeding' is a more appropriate description."},{"T":"301","3":"To him, Lamia is probably just a collection of many parameters."},{"T":"301","3":"Height, weight, blood pressure, heart rate, vital capacity, basic metabolism. As long as these numbers are normal, he would not spend a little more time on Lamia."},{"T":"301","3":"Lamia once tried to scream and cry in front of him."},{"T":"301","3":"He had only one reaction: to diagnose if Lamia had any mental illness. After confirming that she was only throwing a tantrum, he immediately went back to work."},{"T":"301","3":"He is now busy working on his desk, writing some sentences that Lamia cannot understand."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"What are you doing, uncle?"},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"Working."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"But your job is to treat patients, isn't it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"That was the old one. My mission has changed."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"What do you mean that your mission has changed?"},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"Soon, there won't be a medical director. I need to write down the instructions for my colleagues so they know how to use the medications."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"I... don't understand."},{"T":"301","3":"To her surprise, he is not annoyed by her ignorance."},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"You know we are running low on rations, don't you?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"Yes."},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"Our food supplies won't last too long."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"What should we do then?"},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"Easy. We just need to cut down on consumption."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"H-how are you going to do that?"},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"We can let some people starve to death."},{"T":"301","3":"Lamia opens her eyes wide."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"B-but, who is going to die?"},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"The order is determined by how important their roles are to our current research."},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"Starting from the admin department, followed by the logistics and then the medical department."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"Are you... going to die too?"},{"T":"301","3":"He sounds extremely calm."},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"Of course. As a member of the medical department, I am no exception."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"The medical director never looks back. Lamia only sees his cold, distant back.
