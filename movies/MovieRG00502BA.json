It's Michael!"},{"T":"302","2":"Michael?"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"He's from t-that movie... When did he start following us?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Right from the beginning. He showed no harm, so I didn't take action."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"I see... I thought this was 'The Darkening', but it turned out to be 'that movie'..."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Wow... Lucky I watched 'that movie' without letting Capt know..."},{"T":"302","2":"What's 'that movie'?","4":"Why not let him know?"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Oh, Wanshi got a movie..."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"The name was 'The Darkening'. It was supposed to be a 'horror movie,' so Capt never let us play it in the preparation room..."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Um, this is only between the two of us... Capt thought the taste of that movie was 'extremely poor,' so he never allowed us to watch it..."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Plus, only the beginning was almost identical to 'The Darkening', but the story was quite different..."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"So I didn't recognize it until we got here."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"What's with this place?"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"This is where the movie ended.

Lee?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"I just cannot understand the fun of those completely illogical works."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"See, Commandant?"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Anyway, this is probably our only chance of beating that masked killer."},{"T":"302","2":"Alright...

According to the movie's background, the killer is only mortal inside this house."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Which means we can only kill him within the house."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"That's the problem... I don't know."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"When Wanshi and I almost finished the movie... The file was corrupted."},{"T":"301","2":"Narration","3":"You suddenly hear a squeaking sound from behind.
