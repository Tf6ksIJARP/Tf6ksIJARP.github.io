Under the dim light on the ring, a hint of redness seems to be lining her cheeks."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Really? I'm glad you liked it."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Never thought I'd have a chance to come here and witness your sword dance again."},{"T":"301","3":"Looking back, a Construct holding a red umbrella is standing nearby."},{"T":"302","2":"It's been a while."},{"T":"301","2":"Yazi","3":"It wasn't that long before that last battle."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"That last battle?"},{"T":"301","2":"Yazi","3":"That's right, I was also here with...

It'll be enough for that ruckus out there."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Thank you."},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia takes the prize before handing it to you."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Can I give it to you as a gift?"},{"T":"302","2":"It belongs to us both."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Right..."},{"T":"301","2":"Yazi","3":"But it's not worthy of your sword dance. What else would you want?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...What I want?"},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia lowers her head and thinks for a while, then looks up into your eyes."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"I want to... create some new memories."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Memories with \u3010kuroname\u3011."},{"T":"301","3":"Yazi points to the opposite compartment where a guqin sits."},{"T":"301","2":"Yazi","3":"Do you wish to learn the guqin?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"The guqin...?"},{"T":"301","2":"Yazi","3":"I don't know what kind of memories you're referring to, but being taught the art of guqin... was a nice piece of memory for me."},{"T":"301","2":"Yazi","3":"I could teach you if you want."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"I'm not sure I'm built for this..."},{"T":"302","2":"Of course you are.","4":"I'd like to hear you play."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Then I'll give it a try."},{"T":"301","2":"Yazi","3":"I'll upload the guqin score data to her. It'll take but a moment."},{"T":"301","3":"The two walk over to the guqin and perform a simple transmission and tuning."},{"T":"301","2":"Yazi","3":"Give it a go."},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia nods and sits in front of the guqin. She raises her hand and plucks the strings in front of her. Notes fall into the lake like flower petals and leaves, echoing in the pavilion with the ripples of peace."},{"T":"301","3":"All of a sudden, the gentle, breeze-like style changes into a tempest. Her fingers dance over the strings of the guqin, imaginary drums and horns reverberating in unison, like blood and iron burning before your eyes."},{"T":"301","3":"The sounds suddenly halt at a blood-boiling climax. And when she resumes, it is followed by a mournful sound, like the night rain falling on abandoned weapons in the wasteland, leaving only sorrowful echoes behind."},{"T":"301","3":"After the song, Lucia lays her hands between her knees and looks this way timidly, as if asking for your opinion."},{"T":"302","2":"That was beautiful."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Then I'm relieved. I was worried you wouldn't like this kind of music."},{"T":"302","2":"It's like our fights together.","4":"It's like our memories."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Yes... I feel the same way."},{"T":"301","2":"Yazi","3":"So, are you happy with this extra 'prize'?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Yes, thank you."},{"T":"301","2":"Yazi","3":"We were in a hurry, so I didn't get to teach you much. But it's good that you've made some new memories with it."},{"T":"301","2":"Yazi","3":"It's late. I guess the others would be back by now. Go meet the others."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"You're right. Let's go."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Commandant...?"},{"T":"301","3":"Liv seems a bit surprised."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"Alright, I'll be the guide for the other two."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"Don't you still have to patrol the place?"},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"Guiding IS patrolling."},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia falls silent. She merely stares at you two quietly."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Lucia, let's see if we can find any useful parts around."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Yeah, let's meet here after again getting our crafts, Commandant."},{"T":"302","2":"Okay."},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia only turns to follow the group that just departed after you nod at her."},{"T":"302","2":"We should get going too."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"(Nods) ...Let's go to the night market and see if there are any crafts for sale that meet the requirements."},{"T":"301","3":"You arrive at the entrance of the night market with Liv. The buildings here are still the same as they were, but the vendors look understandably calmer."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"I wonder what kind of crafts would pass the pre-selection..."},{"T":"301","2":"Craftsman","3":"Homemade mechanical puppets! Check it out, 20% off for the festival!"},{"T":"301","3":"The craftsman yells as he grins at the oncoming guests."},{"T":"301","2":"Craftsman","3":"He notices that Liv is not human and freezes for a while, but soon returns to normal."},{"T":"301","2":"Craftsman","3":"Nice lady, would you like one? Great for homes and travels, suitable as bodyguards and babysitters, these are simply the best!"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Commandant, what do you think?"},{"T":"302","2":"Sounds practical.","4":"I don't think it can pass the pre-selection."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Well..."},{"T":"301","2":"Craftsman","3":"It's more than practical. The ones on the left can also sing operas!"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"I think we'll pass. Thank you."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Let's go somewhere else."},{"T":"301","2":"Craftsman","3":"Hey, don't go! I can make it any way you want, it just takes a little time and... some more grubs."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Thanks, we'll be back later."},{"T":"301","3":"After saying goodbye to the craftsman with the mechanical puppets, the two of you squeeze into the bustling crowd."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"I haven't seen anyone like that man before..."},{"T":"302","2":"That man?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Ah... sorry, you were unaware of the reason for the dispute here before."},{"T":"301","3":"Liv explains in detail what happened the last time she was on the Nighter."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"I was too reckless... if you hadn't arrived in time, it would have been trouble."},{"T":"302","2":"But I had."},{"T":"301","3":"Liv puts her hands on her chest and nods gently."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"...I'm glad you don't find me troublesome."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"But if I had left a sick person alone, I would definitely have regretted it even more afterward."},{"T":"302","2":"There's nothing wrong with being kind."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"(Nods) ...I'm relieved to hear you say this."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"How about we go pick out gifts for everyone?"},{"T":"301","3":"Liv turns around with a smile and walks in delight."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"There are a lot of people at the stall over there. Let's go take a look, shall we?"},{"T":"302","2":"(Nod)"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"This clockwork frog is so cute! Although it can't be used for pre-selection, should we still buy it for Lucia?"},{"T":"302","2":"Sure.","4":"Let's keep looking."},{"T":"301","2":"Vendor","3":"Thank you!"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Will Lucia be delighted to see this?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"But... it should be fine if you say so."},{"T":"301","3":"Liv pockets the clockwork frog carefully and gently smiles."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Hmm... if you say so."},{"T":"301","3":"Liv puts the clockwork frog down carefully and gives an apologetic smile."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"This set of tools is rare. Would Lee like it...?"},{"T":"302","2":"He does like practical things.","4":"Let's keep looking."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"You're right... You know everyone so well."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Please, this tool set."},{"T":"301","2":"Vendor","3":"Good choice! Here."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Well, where do you want to go next, Commandant?"},{"T":"301","3":"Liv sidles closer to you and looks at you in anticipation."},{"T":"302","2":"Let's go buy a gift."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Oh? Who is it for?"},{"T":"302","2":"Liv.","4":"What do you want, Liv?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Huh? F-for me?"},{"T":"301","3":"Liv lowers her head and blushes."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"I just... want you to recover soon..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"As long as you can stay with me... with us, it'd be the best gift for me."},{"T":"302","2":"I'll stay with you.","4":"But I also want to find a gift for you."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"...Is that so?"},{"T":"301","3":"She clutches her hands, trembling as if hesitating to say something."},{"T":"301","3":"Just then, a roar resounds from afar."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Get out!"},{"T":"301","2":"Skinny Boy","3":"Please..."},{"T":"301","3":"Looking in the direction of the roar, you see two slender figures being pushed to the ground.

W-why won't you..."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"I said I don't want it!"},{"T":"301","3":"He stomps on the prosthetic hand clutching onto his left leg, but it does not let go even in its half-broken state."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Hand me a fresh one from your own body, and maybe I'll think about it."},{"T":"301","2":"Skinny Boy","3":"O-okay..."},{"T":"301","3":"Not expecting that he would agree, the tall man freezes for a minute. He then grabs the boy by the hair and picks him up."},{"T":"301","2":"Skinny Boy","3":"I'll sell anything... if I can get enough money from it..."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"What do you need money for if you don't have your life to spend it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Skinny Boy","3":"If I can get my sister to a safe zone... and get her treated, that'll be enough..."},{"T":"301","2":"Sick Girl","3":"(Sobs)"},{"T":"301","3":"Hearing this, the man sneers and throws the boy to the ground."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"...!"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Hmph, the woman who'd buy it turned herself into this a long time ago."},{"T":"301","3":"He shakes the bag of grubs in his hands and laughs indifferently."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"You might still have a way out if you leave your sister behind."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Commandant! Please... please allow me to..."},{"T":"302","2":"(Go stop him)"},{"T":"301","3":"The tall man grabs a metal plate from his side, but is thrown to the ground the moment he tries to pummel the child with it."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"The hell are you?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Please stop it!"},{"T":"301","3":"He clearly has not expected a frail-looking girl like Liv would scold him."},{"T":"301","3":"Without so much of a further look, he spits in disdain and stands, again swinging the metal plate hard at the two."},{"T":"301","3":"But before he manages to do so, he is back on the ground. Liv has not even lifted her hands."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Commandant, you're still wounded. Please don't be reckless!"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"You... you're a Construct? Tch!"},{"T":"301","3":"Realizing it, the man takes a few steps back cautiously.

Better?"},{"T":"301","2":"Sick Girl","3":"Yes... thank you..."},{"T":"301","3":"At this moment, a scurry of footsteps travels over. The skinny boy runs over with a small magpie made of old gears and copper wires."},{"T":"301","2":"Skinny Boy","3":"J-just in time! This is for you!"},{"T":"301","3":"The magpie he hands over looks ancient and rusty from the material, but it is still an impressive and detailed masterpiece."},{"T":"302","2":"That's beautiful, thanks."},{"T":"301","3":"After carefully putting away the metal magpie, you hand the remaining bag of grubs to the boy."},{"T":"301","2":"Skinny Boy","3":"This is..."},{"T":"302","2":"Commission fee for your craft.","4":"Hope that helps."},{"T":"301","2":"Skinny Boy","3":"Th-thank you..."},{"T":"301","3":"The boy receives the bag of grubs in excitement with both hands, as if seeing a hint of light in the darkness, and he says nothing but thanks."},{"T":"302","2":"But, well..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"What is it?"},{"T":"302","2":"The market is closed already."},{"T":"301","3":"After realizing this, Liv lets out a small cry."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Ah, I didn't get a chance to buy you a gift...

You haven't told me what you want."},{"T":"302","2":"I'd like to see you happy.","4":"Thanks for staying with me."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"...Ah."},{"T":"301","3":"Liv freezes for a while and quickly lowers her head, putting her hands on her chest. Although you cannot see her expression, you can feel her shoulders slightly trembling."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Thank you... Commandant. Thank you."},{"T":"302","2":"I'm the one who should thank you."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"...Hmm..."},{"T":"301","3":"Liv's voice is soft, and she seems to be in a bit of a daze."},{"T":"302","2":"We should get back."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Yeah... let's go back together."},{"T":"301","3":"You think you can hear Lee sigh."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Don't you have other options?"},{"T":"302","2":"There's no one but you."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"What's this supposed to be? Some sort of training?"},{"T":"302","2":"You know how to make little robots.","4":"That's not a bad idea."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"And you think that passes as a craft?"},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"Of course! It's not about looks. As long as you make it delicate enough, there won't be a problem!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"..."},{"T":"302","2":"You don't want to go with me?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"...It's not like that."},{"T":"302","2":"Let's go then."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Look at you, all running and jumping. I guess you're almost recovered, huh?"},{"T":"301","3":"He looks at you in silence for a few seconds."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Never mind... Let's just get it done and come back as soon as possible."},{"T":"301","3":"He stops speaking and walks over."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"Alright, then I'll show the rest of you around. Lucia, Liv!"},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"Don't you still have to patrol the place?"},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"Guiding IS patrolling."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"Oh yeah, by the way, there wasn't a winner in the last fighting tournament, so the prize is still here. Lucia, are you interested? You'll definitely get it if you give it a try."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Is that so? Then let's go take a look."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"Liv, would you like to take a look at the night market? There are a lot of interesting crafts on sale right now."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Yeah, I can buy some souvenirs for everyone."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Commandant, we'll be waiting here for you after completing our tasks."},{"T":"302","2":"Alright."},{"T":"301","3":"As the three of them walk and talk, Lee turns around and looks at you."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Which way?"},{"T":"302","2":"Lee, is there anywhere you'd like to go?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"No."},{"T":"302","2":"Then we can just walk around."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"...Alright."},{"T":"301","3":"The two of you walk along the taffrail of the Nighter, listening to the sound of the waves until the moon shines right above you. The silver threads of moonlight pour from above, softly draping over Lee's silent profile."},{"T":"301","3":"Wordlessly, he walks on your left side. Only this time, his pace is slow, unlike his usual self."},{"T":"302","2":"Why are you walking so slowly?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"You haven't recovered yet."},{"T":"302","2":"But last time..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Last time?"},{"T":"301","3":"He turns in confusion, unable to comprehend your words."},{"T":"302","2":"I mean when we were picking up the parts.","4":"You kept walking ahead and then stopping to wait for me."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Do you always keep these trivial details in your mind?"},{"T":"302","2":"It wasn't trivial."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Unlike last time, there's no need to hurry now."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Besides, we've been fighting a lot lately. Since it's just a festival, there's no need to tire you out."},{"T":"302","2":"Why don't we just sit down, then?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Tired? Alright."},{"T":"301","3":"He looks around and sets his eyes on a sea-viewing pavilion not far away."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Let's go over there."},{"T":"302","2":"Okay."},{"T":"301","3":"After sitting on the bench in the pavilion, you notice that Lee is looking at you."},{"T":"302","2":"What's the matter?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Are you tired?"},{"T":"302","2":"I can still handle it.","4":"Worried about me?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"That's good."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"You wish."},{"T":"301","3":"Lee looks away and sits down next to you, exceptionally silent."},{"T":"301","3":"The noises of the night market come from afar. Unlike that sparkling place, only moonlight, the sound of waves, and Lee are here."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Regret coming here with me? We can still head for the market and buy some parts there."},{"T":"301","3":"It could be nice to walk around, but the long walk must have taken a toll on you, especially with your injuries. You are a little too exhausted for another long trek."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Would you like me to teach you some engineering theory? Not a bad idea to learn something in your free time."},{"T":"302","2":"Let's rest up first.","4":"It's good enough to have you here."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"..."},{"T":"302","2":"Is your cooling device still broken?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Shut up."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Look over there."},{"T":"301","3":"You follow the direction Lee points and look at the starry sky."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"There are three stars in the Milky Way to the southeast, Alpha Cygni, Alpha Lyrae, and Alpha Aquilae."},{"T":"302","2":"It's the 'Summer Triangle', right?"},{"T":"301","3":"Lee nods."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"In Kowloong, Alpha Lyrae and Alpha Aquila seem to be called 'Vega' and 'Altair'."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Which represent the 'weaving maid' and the 'cowherd.'"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"I guess they are what the two protagonists in the Double Seventh Festival are based on."},{"T":"302","2":"I didn't know."},{"T":"301","3":"The two stars in the sky are on different sides of the Milky Way. Lee peels his eyes off the sky and looks at you."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"The distance between the two stars is 16.4 light-years, or 160 trillion kilometers."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"The average length of a magpie is 40 to 50 cm. Even without considering physics, it would take 330 quadrillion magpies to build a magpie bridge..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"..."},{"T":"302","2":"What is it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Anyway, the magpie bridge is not possible."},{"T":"302","2":"Of course I know that. It's just a story."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"...Humans in the past couldn't explain things beyond their understandings, so they'd make up all sorts of tales to address their confusion."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Even now, with powerful technology and high computing power, there are still things that I fail to understand."},{"T":"302","2":"Like what?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Nothing."},{"T":"301","3":"He looks up at the starry sky and stops talking."},{"T":"301","3":"Perhaps because of the frequent battles or the unplanned relief, the endless ocean ahead fills you with drowsiness."},{"T":"301","3":"The swaying ship with the sound of waves is like a perfect cradle. Even the noises of the night market from afar gradually fade."},{"T":"301","2":"?","3":"...Oh, you."},{"T":"301","3":"As you drift in and out of sleep, you seem to hear someone talking."},{"T":"301","2":"?","3":"...You said you'd go with me, but I have no idea how to make you happy."},{"T":"301","2":"?","3":"...The battles have been getting more frequent lately."},{"T":"301","2":"?","3":"I know it's our duty, but I don't want to be commanded by you if you don't care about your own safety."},{"T":"301","3":"You want to answer him, but sleepiness sweeps over you and pulls you further into your dream."},{"T":"301","2":"?","3":"\u3010kuroname\u3011... I don't want that kind of memories anymore."},{"T":"301","3":"The moon rises into the sky, and the sea breeze of the night blows across the railings, sending a chill to this quiet place."},{"T":"301","3":"You cannot help but shiver, but soon feel some kind of warmth dispelling the chill."},{"T":"301","3":"You fall into a deep sleep surrounded by the warmth."},{"T":"301","3":"In your dream, there is a piercing siren, but it is soon muffled by something, and its sound falls distant."},{"T":"301","3":"Then, a vague figure seems to approach you while being chased by a security robot."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Catch that thief!"},{"T":"301","2":"?","3":"Tsk."},{"T":"302","2":"...Another fight?"},{"T":"301","2":"?","3":"So noisy!"},{"T":"301","3":"As you struggle to wake up, the harsh sounds suddenly disappear."},{"T":"301","3":"\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026"},{"T":"301","3":"You are not sure how long it has been, but you seem to hear someone sigh in your daze."},{"T":"301","2":"?","3":"...Quite a sleepyhead you are. Learn to put up more of a guard."},{"T":"301","3":"You open your eyes to find yourself wrapped in Lee's warm coat. Soft cotton balls cover your ears, blocking the noise outside."},{"T":"301","3":"Removing them, you hear the sound of the crowd leaving reverberating from afar. The night market is coming to a close."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"You're awake?"},{"T":"302","2":"Shoot, we haven't bought the parts!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"There's no need."},{"T":"301","3":"He hands over a ship model, which looks almost identical to the Nighter."},{"T":"302","2":"...What's this?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"I made it while you were asleep. It's probably enough for the event."},{"T":"301","3":"Looking closely at the delicate model of the Nighter, you cannot help but find the color scheme of some of the parts oddly familiar. They look like... the police robots on the Nighter?"},{"T":"302","2":"...Where did you get the materials?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Well, that's a secret."},{"T":"301","3":"He stands up in the dim moonlight."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"It's getting late. Let's go back."}]
