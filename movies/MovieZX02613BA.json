[{"T":"301","3":"When she opens her eyes again, Nanami finds herself back in the digital world. It seems like she managed to link herself up to the terminal after all."},{"T":"301","3":"Before Nanami says anything, she hears Gestalt's cold, hollow voice through the space."},{"T":"301","2":"Gestalt","3":"The machines that have awakened are bound to rule this planet. It is history's choice."},{"T":"301","2":"Gestalt","3":"The Punishing Virus only intensified the war between humans and machines. This future was always inevitable, and it was something that my maker saw all the way back in the Golden Age."},{"T":"301","3":"Not moving an inch, Nanami is surrounded by several bubbles, each of which shows a possible future that derives from the existing reality. Snowy, war-torn, blood-red\u2014the bubbles show all sorts of possible futures, but in none of them can Nanami see humankind."},{"T":"301","3":"Humankind will eventually perish\u2014Gestalt never doubted this, and it holds true in all the possible futures, which is why humanity is nowhere to be seen even in futures blessed by spring."},{"T":"301","3":"She casts away the data and walks forward. Although she cannot see Gestalt, she still raises her head and makes a statement."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"This is definitely not the answer Nanami is seeking."},{"T":"301","2":"Gestalt","3":"You 'must' do it.

Humankind, however, was destroyed by their own arrogance, and that's their problem."},{"T":"301","2":"Gestalt","3":"Human civilization is destined to perish in an 'Ever-Winter' anyway, even if the machines had never awakened."},{"T":"301","2":"Gestalt","3":"Humankind is making too slow a progress, and the awakening of the machines will only get in their way. It's even safe to say that humankind met its end sooner than foreseen because of the Punishing Virus and the awakening of the machines."},{"T":"301","2":"Gestalt","3":"And you never wanted to destroy humankind yourself because you love them so much."},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami's hands clench into fists, then slowly relax."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"But that's not it... That kind of machine is part of our future.

Do they really deserve those endings?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"I don't trust you anymore... If you cannot calculate an ending, I'll go look for it myself."},{"T":"301","2":"Gestalt","3":"In the upcoming 10 years, there are 85,412 future events that can change the future.

There is no way someone as stupid as you will ever understand!"},{"T":"301","2":"Gestalt","3":"I take it that you\u2014the entity called Nanami\u2014plan to figure out every possible future that derives from each future event.
