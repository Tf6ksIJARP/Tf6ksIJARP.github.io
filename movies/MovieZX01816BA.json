[{"T":"301","3":"The pure white world is stable and sweet."},{"T":"301","3":"The world is no longer pale as Wanshi regains consciousness. He realizes he is inside a building."},{"T":"301","3":"The surrounding walls are covered with neat and orderly knife scratches as if someone was counting something. However, there are far too many scratches to count now."},{"T":"301","3":"Wanshi tries to send activation signals to his limbs, but his attempts are futile."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Hmph... Guess I can't move."},{"T":"301","3":"Right as he tries to assess the damage to his body, his vision is filled with the black hole of a muzzle."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"I wouldn't move if I were you."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"(Seeing as he didn't kill me while I was out, I'd wager he isn't a part of the same organization as that 'Gear' thing. Maybe I...)"},{"T":"301","3":"While Wanshi is thinking about what to say, the old man takes the initiative."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Hey, what the hell are you?"},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Huh?"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"You look like a human, but there ain't a single human thing aboutcha."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"You're obviously a machine, but you ain't acting like those crazy ****ers wanderin' around outside. Who are you and whatcha doin' here?"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Choose your words carefully. Dependin' on your answer, you'll either be greeted with a bullet from my gun or a good mornin' kiss."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"I'm just a Construct that came here by mistake..."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Huh? What the hell is a Construct?"},{"T":"301","3":"And with that, the old man aims his rifle at Wanshi's forehead."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Don't you know...? It's a bit of hassle to explain. In short, it is a humanoid robot made of tantalum copolymer with the help of a human consciousness module..."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Alright, alright, alright! Enough!"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"...So, they put a human brain in this tin can?"},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Uh... I guess you could put it like that."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"****, ain't that some blasphemy. Do humans really wanna run around on Earth like that?"},{"T":"301","3":"The old man spits to the side and lowers his rifle from Wanshi's forehead."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"I ain't ever seen any fella like you before."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"...Construct, eh? That's a mouthful. I'll just call you by your name. Name's Arnold. What's your name?"},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Uh... Wanshi."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Wanshi? ****, that ain't much better."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Anyways, looks like you've seen better days."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"This place has been abandoned for quite some time. I ain't seen anyone alive here in ages. How'd you end up here?"},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"...I don't remember. I don't even know where this place is."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"All I know is that the mission I was carrying out failed, so I was en route to the evac point."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"And then... I, uh... just fell asleep."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"More like knocked the **** out. Fell asleep my ***."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"You were on a mission, eh...? Lookin' at your gear and nameplate, guessin' you're a soldier?"},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Don't wanna tell me who ya are? Not like it matters."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"I wouldn't be goin' 'round runnin' my mouth tellin' my life story to folks I just met neither."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Sorry."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Don't mention it. Soldiers are all the same. I get it."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Oh... You were a soldier?"},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"I just know a dumb*** war vet is all."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Sounds like you two were close..."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Live long enough, and you'll find yourself a few buddies. Same goes for you, right?"},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Uh... You could say so."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"With wounds as bad as these, I can hear them yelling at me whenever I close my eyes..."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"I ain't no grease monkey, but I can sure as hell say it's a miracle you made it this far."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"If me and my buddy hadn't kept workin' on you while you were knocked out, who knows when you'da woken up."},{"T":"301","3":"Just like that, a small round robot appears at Wanshi's bedside. Arnold waves to the robot, and it jumps on his shoulder. It seems that this is what Arnold calls his 'buddy.'"},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"We could only patch you up a bit. After all, I ain't ever seen this kinda tech before."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Thanks... But why did you help me?"},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Tch... Because of a promise I made with that dumb***."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Of course, I got my own reasons. But that's in the past."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Anyways, you're safe for now."},{"T":"301","3":"Arnold gestures with his hand and walks over to a corner."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"You hungry, Wanshi? I still got some canned herrin'."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Constructs can eat. But in theory, we don't have to."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"(Whistles) Ain't that convenient."},{"T":"301","3":"Arnold takes out a knife from his waistband and skillfully opens some bulging cans. Suddenly, a strange pungent smell fills the confined space and somehow manages to reactivate Wanshi's damaged smell module."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Phew... What's that? I think I'd have nightmares if I ate that."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Kids these days. It tastes healthy and keeps you on your toes. And to think I wanted to share it with you. Guests ain't easy to come by, ya know?"},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Now ain't like it was in the past. When I'd eat, I'd set up a table outside and ask my buddy to play my favorite bass tunes."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"I'd eat herrin' with crispbread, potato and butter, listen to tunes, and kick up my feet in the evenin' breeze. No people makin' a ruckus and none of these buildings blockin' my view of the sky."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Moonlight and stars shinin' all over me\u2014ain't nothin' like that now."},{"T":"301","3":"After opening the can with his knife, Arnold begins munching on the fish as he reflects on scenes of his past."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"But thanks to those monsters, it ain't easy findin' supplies and I can't stay out too long."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Oh... Wow. I can't even imagine."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Bahahaha! That's normal. A lotta stuff ya gotta see for yourself."},{"T":"301","3":"Arnold smiles and puts the last piece of fish from the can in his mouth with his knife."},{"T":"301","3":"Just then, Wanshi notices the sphere bot on Arnold's shoulder shutter slightly."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Why's there always gotta be problems when I'm eatin'?"},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"What is it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Ain't nothin'. I gotta go out for a sec."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Really? At a time like this?"},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"You betcha. How else would an ol' man like me still be around?"},{"T":"301","3":"Arnold grabs his rifle, climbs up the ladder on the wall, opens the closed hatch above his head, and leaves the room."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Well, I guess I'll take this time to..."},{"T":"301","3":"Right as Arnold leaves, Wanshi closes his eyes and begins to run diagnostics on the extent of internal damage."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Has the damage from the battle and the side effects from the temporary blockage now completely blocked my internal connection circuits? What a drag..."},{"T":"301","3":"Looking around, a cloud of gray and yellow dust fills the underground space. The only light within the room comes from the beta lamp overhead."},{"T":"301","3":"On one side of the room, parts are stacked on what appears to be a mechanical workbench. However, the layer of dust indicates that these items have not been used in quite some time."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"I wonder if Troy has reached the evac point safely."},{"T":"301","3":"After thinking for a while, Wanshi shakes his head and closes his eyes."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Well, looks like there's nothing I can do right now. I guess I'll just kick up my feet for a while..."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"I'm back! Miss me, kiddo?"},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Yawn... Oh, you're back..."},{"T":"301","3":"Arnold's loud voice wakes up Wanshi. Half-awake, Wanshi barely manages to open his eyes and look in Arnold's direction."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Oof, today took a little longer than usual."},{"T":"301","3":"After climbing down the ladder, Arnold throws his rifle to the side and collapses on the shabby sofa in the corner."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"I dunno why, but there are more of those damn monsters wanderin' 'round outside than ever before."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"They're wanderin' 'round like a herd of sheep."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Could it be..."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Don't worry 'bout it. I took care of them already."},{"T":"301","3":"Arnold reaches for his windbreaker, then quickly points his finger out in front of him like shooting a gun."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"All the top actors used to do this."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Oh... You don't say..."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Tsk, you kiddos don't understand why women used to fall head over heels for this kinda thing."},{"T":"301","3":"Arnold's mouth curls into a half-hearted smile. He crosses his legs and reclines on the sofa."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"I wonder if these monsters are actin' so strange has got somethin' to do with labelin' you as some sorta fugitive..."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Yeah... I think this place is going to be crawling with danger here soon."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"You leave while you still can, Arnold."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Who the hell do you think I am?"},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Think I can just leave you here in your condition and save my own hide?"},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"But you don't have to do it for a stranger..."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"I don't care even if we just met. I ain't gonna do it."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Do you know what it's like livin' in a prosperous and bleak metropolis?"},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"City-folk turn a blind eye to those around 'em. That's how awful society was like during the Golden Age."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Hmph. People used to care about each other."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"You won't read about that in those data files of yours."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Changes like that in society can't be recorded in those files with just a few words or statistics."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"I've seen the kindness of humanity and experienced the indifference of society."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Human society flourished for a time, but then they became indifferent to each other."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"I can't watch people survive in such indifference and selfishness. I ain't gonna join them, and I sure as hell ain't gonna be like them."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"But that don't mean I hate humanity. Quite the opposite actually. We can't just give up on others, no matter who it is."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Callin' it 'escaping' sounds nice, but it's really just weakness."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"I don't wanna see this kinda weakness in humanity, so that's why I live here alone with my buddy."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"But I still can't sit by and ignore the lives of others."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"So ya see, it's the two of us who are gonna get outta here alive."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"But..."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"But I know you can't move in your condition."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"So, how 'bout this. I fix ya up, and we get the hell outta Dodge?"},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Huh?"},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Don't underestimate this ol' timer. I used to be a doctor. That's how I've managed to modify this ol' body of mine and keep it up and running for so long."},{"T":"301","3":"Arnold walks up to Wanshi and lifts up his coat, revealing numerous surgical scars covering his body."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"...I see."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"But it ain't easy operatin' alone. That's why I built my partner here to lend a hand."},{"T":"301","3":"Arnold straightens out his clothes with one hand and pats the sphere bot on his shoulder with the other."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Well then, tell me what I need to know to get up in there and fix those nuts and bolts of yours. I can't just go in blind. I wanna show you my handiwork."},{"T":"301","3":"Arnold dusts off the workstation and wheels it over to Wanshi's bedside."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Like you said, time is of the essence. Let's get this over and done with."}]
