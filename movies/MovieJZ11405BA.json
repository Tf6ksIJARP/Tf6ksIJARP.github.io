[{"T":"301","3":"Rosetta jumps onto the narwhal and gently carries Pfaff back to the boat. Only then did she realize that part of Pfaff's body is beginning to rot."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"How'd this happen! But you didn't get hurt, Grandpa..."},{"T":"301","2":"Pfaff","3":"The Punishing... Damnit... And at a time like this..."},{"T":"301","3":"Rosetta has heard of the Punishing Virus from Pfaff not long after setting out to sea. It is a terrible virus that had ravaged the world at the height of the Golden Age."},{"T":"301","3":"The horrific virus had spread everywhere except high altitude areas like the Arctic. Only a special serum can mitigate the effects of the virus."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"So, Grandpa, the thing you said I had to inject everyday... That's the serum?!"},{"T":"301","3":"Rosetta searches Pfaff for a shot of the serum in a panic, but Pfaff gently grabs her hand and shakes his head."},{"T":"301","2":"Pfaff","3":"Don't bother looking... I've run out of mine... for quite some time now..."},{"T":"301","3":"Rosetta checks the boat. There is only enough serum left for one person to make the voyage back."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Why...? Why didn't we go back when you knew it's not going to be enough?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Pfaff","3":"I have to kill the narwhal, no matter what\u2014even if it kills me."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"But why?! I don't understand..."},{"T":"301","2":"Pfaff","3":"Because Grandpa has sinned. Far more than the Forest Guards... So there's no need to feel any regret."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"But Grandpa, you've never done anything bad. How could you be a sinner? They must've made a mistake!"},{"T":"301","2":"Pfaff","3":"Rosetta, listen to me. Killing the narwhal is our only chance to be allowed into the ARU."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"If that's the case, then I don't wanna join 'em! Weren't we doing okay just living in the forest?"},{"T":"301","2":"Pfaff","3":"For me, it is, but not for you. I can't allow you to be stuck there your whole life. You need friends... You need a future..."},{"T":"301","3":"Rosetta becomes quiet. She has friends in the port. If she could live a life like an ordinary girl..."},{"T":"301","3":"Pfaff shoves the high-voltage harpoon into Rosetta's hand. He points it at the narwhal's eye and nods."},{"T":"301","2":"Pfaff","3":"Kill the narwhal while you have the chance. Take the core of its electronic brain back to the port manager. He'll know what it is."},{"T":"301","3":"Rosetta takes the harpoon. She shambles absently toward the narwhal, staring into its eyes."},{"T":"301","3":"The narwhal is tranquil as if it has accepted its fate. They both stare silently into each other's eyes."},{"T":"301","2":"Pfaff","3":"(Once you kill it, Rosetta, you'll be free...)"},{"T":"301","2":"Pfaff","3":"(You'll no longer have to bear this sin that never was yours. You'll finally get to be a normal girl. You'll get to live without any regrets.)"},{"T":"301","3":"But Rosetta shakes her head instead. She throws the harpoon into the sea and kneels beside the narwhal."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"If you are the Guardian Spirit of humanity, please listen to my only prayer..."},{"T":"301","3":"The young maiden can no longer hold back her tears."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Please, save my grandpa... Please... I beg of you..."},{"T":"301","3":"Only with the speed of the narwhal, can the two of them make it back to New Murmansk with the serum they have left."},{"T":"301","2":"Pfaff","3":"Rosetta, give up... It's not a guardian spirit at all. It won't respond to you."},{"T":"301","2":"Pfaff","3":"We created it... It's just a cold and heartless machine. It's an irrevocable proof of our sin in a foolish age."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"But it chose to protect humanity rather than fight. It's our friend, not a cold-hearted weapon."},{"T":"301","3":"The eyes of the narwhal flicker. It lets out a bellowing roar. Toiling visibly, it makes a hard turn and begins dragging their boat to the north."},{"T":"301","2":"Pfaff","3":"Impossible... The narwhal's M.I.N.D. awakened...? Because of Rosetta?"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"We can't keep calling it the 'Guardian Spirit' or just a 'narwhal'. It should have its own name."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"To become friends, we must know each other's names. Right, Derek?"},{"T":"301","3":"The narwhal lets out a series of groans as if dissatisfied with the silly name, taken and arranged from Drake Passage."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Grandpa, no matter what happened in your past, the three of us have to get back alive. It shouldn't end here!"},{"T":"301","2":"Pfaff","3":"(Rosetta, you've really grown up... Turns out I was the only one trapped in the sins of the past...)"},{"T":"301","3":"And with that, the journey between the two of them and Derek, the narwhal, begins anew."},{"T":"301","3":"But this time, not to a perilous end, but toward their last hope."}]
