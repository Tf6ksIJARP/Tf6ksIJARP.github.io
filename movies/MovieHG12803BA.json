There is no need for you to be out in the open."},{"T":"301","3":"So you followed Babylonia's suggestions and traveled on this long corridor alone after the other Gray Ravens were sent to assist short-staffed teams."},{"T":"301","3":"But you did not expect to run into Haicma. Is she on a special mission where she has to stay hidden? That makes it inappropriate for you to ask her."},{"T":"302","2":"Do the people from the conservation area still distrust the reinforcement from Babylonia?"},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"Trust requires proof. It has to be built upon the foundation of logic and rationality..."},{"T":"301","3":"She suddenly stops talking, her eyes focusing on an unremarkable corner."},{"T":"301","3":"Walking toward there, she kneels down."},{"T":"301","3":"It is a lily buried in the ruins."},{"T":"301","3":"Sustained only by a gleam of sunlight through the cracks, it is on the verge of dying."},{"T":"301","3":"You can hardly describe the flower as sprouting. Every second that wearied plant lives is a mercy from the grim reaper."},{"T":"301","3":"In this gray and dark world, the rubbles build a stage where the dying performer stands in the spotlight, playing the last act of its life."},{"T":"301","3":"The surrounding ruins are waiting for its curtain call so that they may devour its stubborn figure."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"After a short silence, Haicma suddenly stands up."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"It's too late."},{"T":"301","3":"Her pitiful whisper sounds like a sentence."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"There is no feasible way to save it."},{"T":"301","3":"How come?"},{"T":"302","2":"(Inspect)"},{"T":"301","3":"The roots are not rotten, and there are no signs of pest infestation.
