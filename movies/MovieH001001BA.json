You haven't changed coatings in ages, have you, Lucia?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Coatings don't seem to affect my performance in battle, so I haven't noticed."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Hm... I figured you'd say that."},{"T":"301","3":"She chuckles and steps closer to Lucia."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Not even just for fun?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"I heard that coatings weren't just handed out."},{"T":"302","2":"Ahem...","4":"Oh, about that..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"The commandant actually spoke with me about that already..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"About coatings?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Yep!

Absolutely not."},{"T":"301","3":"She quickly turns to the next page and continues browsing."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...How about this one?"},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia points to an icy blue summer coating with soft scales resembling a fish tail.

It's a really romantic but heart-wrenching story."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"A long, long time ago..."},{"T":"301","3":"Right as Liv is about to tell the story, something suddenly draws her attention."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Commandant! There's a distress signal coming from an indistinct source over 18 kilometers south of our position."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Maybe they ran into trouble on their way back to rendezvous?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Maybe it's just an error."},{"T":"302","2":"Let's go check it out.","4":"What if our comrades are in trouble?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"You're right. Seems like the target site is located at sea. We'll need to use the speedboat to get there."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Gray Ravens, move out."},{"T":"301","3":"Thunder rumbles faintly in the dense cloud top, indicating the impending storm."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"We need to hurry."},{"T":"301","3":"The distress signal leads the team to a rickety old yacht.

All she sees is a trail of watery footprints in the wheelhouse."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Someone was just here."},{"T":"301","3":"She quickly walks over to the wheelhouse and carefully examines the surroundings."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Looks like the ship's been abandoned for some time. Someone must've come here and triggered the alarm."},{"T":"301","3":"Hearing a disturbance in the wheelhouse, a horde of Corrupted suddenly converge on the group."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Prepare to engage!"},{"T":"301","3":"The Corrupted are outdated models and their movements are sluggish. The battle is over before it even starts."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Hostiles eliminated."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"We defeated all of the Corrupted, but there's no one left on the boat. Who could've triggered the alarm?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Were we too late?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"No. Maybe they just ran for cover."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Liv, keep searching the area for vital signs."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Understood."},{"T":"301","3":"Liv closes her eyes and amplifies her search module."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Danger!!"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"There's a massive horde of Corrupted coming right for us!

The rickety yacht begins tilting precariously to one side under the torrential downpour, crashing waves, and the horde of Corrupted."},{"T":"301","3":"Unable to react in time, you slide along the slippery deck and into the sea."},{"T":"301","3":"All you can do is grab two Corrupted by their legs and pull them overboard with you.

We need to distract the Corrupted!"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"...!"},{"T":"301","3":"Hearing this, Liv follows Lee along the deck as they cut a path through the waves and Corrupted, then they both jump onto the speedboat."},{"T":"301","3":"In the chaos of the storm, a blue figure pokes her head out of the waves and places the human on a piece of wood from the wreckage..."}]
