Some smile at each other and start the next dance."},{"T":"301","2":"Iris","3":"Shall we take a walk elsewhere?"},{"T":"302","2":"Sure."},{"T":"301","3":"You follow her to a quieter corner, where you can see the outside of Eden through the window. The earth isn't visible on this side; only endless darkness and stars remain in vision."},{"T":"301","3":"The girl has her eyes closed. She tilts her head slightly as she listens to the music from afar. The violin sonata is as vibrant as young birds jumping and chirping on a branch."},{"T":"301","2":"Iris","3":"'Gavotte en Rondeaux'."},{"T":"301","2":"Iris","3":"Have you ever heard that melody, \u3010kuroname\u3011?"},{"T":"302","2":"Yes.","4":"Not really."},{"T":"301","3":"BMV 1006.
