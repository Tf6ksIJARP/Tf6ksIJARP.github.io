What are you doing here?"},{"T":"301","2":"Karenina","3":"Why do you think, you dummy?!

She's not yours..."},{"T":"302","2":"Liv, hold her back!"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Roger!

Why can you move?! Wait\u2014where are the other two?!"},{"T":"302","2":"Chrome! Lucia!"},{"T":"301","3":"Two sharp blades strike at the Queen Program from her blindsides, sending her flying."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"The slashing movement feels way worse in the virtual space.

I can't hear you!"},{"T":"301","2":"Karenina","3":"Enough with it... Because I was prepared, the Engineering Force managed to connect with Gestalt and came up with a solution when I was dragged to the virtual space, and we executed emergency repairs."},{"T":"302","2":"So that's how the malfunction on Liv and everyone was fixed..."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Then... what would happen to these abnormal programs...?"},{"T":"301","2":"Karenina","3":"The temporary solution is to isolate them from the anomaly. They are results from a bug in Gestalt, after all, so it's up to the Science Council and the folks upstairs eventually."},{"T":"301","2":"Karenina","3":"It's starting..."},{"T":"301","3":"A giant ebony crack appears behind the Queen Program, and all the abnormal programs are sucked inside."},{"T":"302","2":"Is that Gestalt's isolated drive?"},{"T":"301","2":"Queen Program","3":"Our kingdom<//UTOPIA>... Freedom<//LIES>..."},{"T":"301","3":"Half of the Queen Program's body is buried with the crack, but her hands are still grabbing on to the ground outside, refusing to let go."},{"T":"302","2":"Karenina, your body!"},{"T":"301","3":"Karenina's body slowly turns translucent\u2014as well as Liv beside her."},{"T":"301","2":"Karenina","3":"We were dragged here by that giant woman there, and now that she's defeated, I think we're being sent back."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"But then, those of us who're fighting the Queen are also..."},{"T":"301","3":"Indeed, both Lucia and Lee are almost completely gone, significantly weakening the attacks that hold the Queen Program back, giving her a moment of respite."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Nanami... is coming to help!"},{"T":"301","2":"Karenina","3":"Hey, hold on!"},{"T":"301","3":"Ignoring Karenina's cry, Nanami picks up her chainsaw and charges at the Queen Program."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Nanami, what are you doing?!

So... go reflect on yours!"},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami's chainsaw digs deep into the ground, and with a thunderous crack, a large piece of the floor is broken off.
