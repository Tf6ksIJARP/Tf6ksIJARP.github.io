The Gray Ravens, if my memory serves me well, were the ones who boarded the train."},{"T":"301","2":"Construct B","3":"Yes, they are the only ones who can deal with the most challenging core."},{"T":"301","3":"The two Constructs kicked open the door of the airdrop pod, conversing via comms and covering each other."},{"T":"301","3":"One batch of Corrupted after another fell victim to the firing.

The ally's abdomen was instantly disintegrated and the body knocked back into the crowd of Corrupted."},{"T":"301","2":"Construct B","3":"Who's there?!"},{"T":"301","3":"The second gunshot was the reply to the Construct's question. Following that, the world fell silent for a little while. Surprisingly, the Corrupted were not charging forward.

Maybe you're the parasite."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Your questioning is worthless, as Miss Luna epitomizes the power of Ascension-Network."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Will you still be loyal to Miss Luna if she loses her power?"},{"T":"301","3":"Silence. The passage of time seemed to stretch on forever, and the station was filled with a suffocating quietness."},{"T":"301","3":"After a long while, Roland broke the silence first."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Don't worry. I'm just messing with you!"},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Humph, my actions speak louder than words. You, on the other hand, have some explaining to do."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Why didn't you finish off the Babylonia Constructs after you defeated them?

The sheer force of the strike even cracked the ground beneath their feet."},{"T":"301","3":"Gabriel had obliterated countless beings with this lethal close-quarters punch. Throughout this encounter, however, he never felt the anticipated impact flow through him."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"H-how's that possible?"},{"T":"301","3":"After the dust from the impact subsided, Roland could be seen with one foot on Gabriel's shoulder, maintaining his nonchalant pose."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Phew, that was close."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"You have been hiding your true power."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Have I? I have no idea."},{"T":"301","3":"Roland then lept off Gabriel's shoulder and walked out of the station."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Okay, there concludes the excursion.
