Because of the Forest Guard?"},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"The Forest Guard is okay. She attacked the ARU base."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Why would she attack a mundane human base if it wasn't because of the Forest Guard?"},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"I'll leave the investigation to you."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"I'll look into it once I finish this up. You should go have a rest."},{"T":"301","3":"Asimov lowers his head to continue his work, only to realize Hassen has no intention of leaving."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"...I'll go look into now then.

People hiding underground follow the Forest Guards out of the tunnel. The snowy surface reflects the dazzling sunlight, blinding them as they exit the tunnel."},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"Any other areas that have gone unchecked?"},{"T":"301","2":"Forest Guard A","3":"This is the last one."},{"T":"301","3":"Seeing the survivors following the Forest Guard poke their heads up from within the tunnel, those on the surface rush over in excitement."},{"T":"301","2":"Fisher A","3":"Where's my wife?! Have you seen my wife?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Child","3":"Cici, what happened to that pretty white light?"},{"T":"301","2":"Forest Guard A","3":"We won't let it come back anymore."},{"T":"301","2":"Fisher B","3":"Mom! Have you seen Aya?"},{"T":"301","2":"Old Lady","3":"That naughty little girl ran up ahead. There she is!"},{"T":"301","2":"Girl","3":"Mommy! Daddy! You're finally back! Huh? Daddy, why is your face covered in ash?"},{"T":"301","2":"Young Father","3":"I was afraid something happened to you. I'm fine, I just tripped is all. As long as you're okay."},{"T":"301","3":"The survivors made loud noises, celebrating, excited, and mourning their sudden financial loss."},{"T":"301","3":"There are those on the snow who cheer and hug in tight embrace. However, not everyone can immerse themselves in the jubilant atmosphere."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"Have you seen my brother? Why isn't he here?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Forest Guard A","3":"Calm down. What's his name?"},{"T":"301","3":"The sailor mentions a name and looks worriedly at the Forest Guard as she inputs the name into the terminal."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"W-where is he?"},{"T":"301","2":"Forest Guard A","3":"He was injured by a collapsed wall. My companions have already sent him to the hospital."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"Is it serious?"},{"T":"301","2":"Forest Guard A","3":"There aren't any reports in the log. However, based on the zone he was sent to, it doesn't look life threatening."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"Thank you! Thank you so much! I'm going to go see him!"},{"T":"301","3":"The sailor repeatedly expresses his gratitude and then leaves with others who are still missing their loved ones to visit the hospital."},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"What's the death toll?"},{"T":"301","2":"Forest Guard A","3":"Most of the people in the areas we searched were injured by collapsing debris or from being trampled as they tried to escape. As for the death toll..."},{"T":"301","3":"The Forest Guard raises her head and gazes off at the distant horizon, seeing the snow-covered hellscape glow in the sunlight."},{"T":"301","3":"She remains quiet for some time, as if reluctant to speak."},{"T":"301","2":"Forest Guard A","3":"I just received a list of the people who went to... the research institute. Almost all the serious injuries and dead are concentrated there."},{"T":"301","2":"Forest Guard A","3":"As for the names on the list, none of them are included on the civilian registration form, except for a few familiar names."},{"T":"301","2":"Forest Guard A","3":"It seems that... Before that, some... people were still buried alive with the secrets of the institute."},{"T":"301","3":"She hesitated a little when speaking. She wanted to add something worthy, but decided to force it down."},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"...The death toll is lower than anticipated. It's a miracle..."},{"T":"301","2":"Forest Guard A","3":"Out of all of this destruction, that's where most of the casualties are? Did she intentionally cause all of this commotion to give people time to evacuate?"},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"I can't say I believe it, but I'd say so based on the death toll... Or was there some hidden motive?"},{"T":"301","3":"The Forest Guard all turn silent."},{"T":"301","2":"Evan","3":"Miss Rosetta?"},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"...She still has a lot to do."},{"T":"301","3":"At this moment, Rosetta stands in the ruins of the research institute looking for survivors."},{"T":"301","2":"Forest Guard C","3":"The hospital staff has already taken them away. But I'm afraid..."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Are there any other survivors?"},{"T":"301","2":"Forest Guard C","3":"All areas have undergone multiple inspections. We haven't seen any signs of life."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"Should we dig deeper?"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"...That won't be necessary anymore. Is there any news outside of the research institute?"},{"T":"301","2":"Forest Guard D","3":"We just received news. The Forsaken and our companions have completed the search and rescue work. The injured have been sent to the hospital for treatment, but no dead were found anywhere except the Research Institute."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"...Only here."},{"T":"301","3":"Rosetta looks at the excavated ruins below. The three broken stone pillars stand askew at the bottom of the underground research lab, like a bloodthirsty demon, stretching out its sharp claws from the darkness below."},{"T":"301","3":"Closing her eyes, it seems as if she can still hear those cries of desperation echoing in the recesses of the 'Reception Hall of Peace'."},{"T":"301","3":"The underground research lab, which had brought nightmares to Amberia and countless other people, has now been turned into ruins in a way she cannot possibly have imagined."},{"T":"301","3":"She lifts the collapsed stone slab, exposing the bloodstained ruins below. The mix of overlapping bright and dark reds is a silent testimony of their suffering."},{"T":"301","3":"Most of those who fled to the research institute knew what secret atrocities were buried here."},{"T":"301","3":"However, it was because of these secrets that they viewed this secret underground research lab as a safe haven."},{"T":"301","3":"The armor plating, execution grounds, and observation rooms built to conduct these experiments gave these people the illusion that they would never be found\u2014much like the secrets kept within these confines."},{"T":"301","3":"'Sinners should be executed where they committed their crimes,' Rosetta has heard. And now, seeing all these people buried in the ruins with countless test subjects, she wonders if they were indeed 'sinners.'"},{"T":"301","3":"Recovering from her brief introspection, Rosetta turns her attention back to the disaster relief work."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"What's your assessment on the damage to the buildings?"},{"T":"301","2":"Forest Guard E","3":"For the time being, I would classify this as C-grade damage. The destroyed houses are mainly concentrated in the area we first witnessed. Most of the buildings in other areas survived."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"Why is it centralized to that area?"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Her destruction to that area must have been a warning."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"A warning? Why would she go through the additional trouble, when this was clearly her target?"},{"T":"301","3":"...Maybe it was to lure those who knew about these secrets to seek shelter in the research institute."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Then destroy them all in one fell swoop..."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"What do you mean?"},{"T":"301","3":"Rosetta does not voice her speculation. Instead, she raises her hand and proceeds to give orders to the Forest Guard."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Let's also go rendezvous with the other Forest Guard and help them with the injured."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Let the refugees take temporary asylum in New Sophiasburgh while reconstruction awaits completion. Only the periphery is left to be built, but looks like there won't be a need for a fence. Let's expand further outward instead."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"...Now is the time for a new beginning."},{"T":"301","3":"Just before leaving, Rosetta turns to look once more at the ruins now turned graveyard."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"When it's all over, we'll come back... We'll rebuild this hall on the bedrock of these ruins."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"But this time, it will be a memorial to history for those to mourn the deceased and... to give them a proper resting place."},{"T":"301","3":"Rosetta follows the footsteps of the crowd and heads toward where the others have gathered."},{"T":"301","3":"Snow mixed with the whimper of the wind fell on the ruins of the research institute, blanketing it a layer of pristine white. However, no amount of snow will cleanse this ruptured earth of its wounds."},{"T":"301","3":"It was as this was nature's 'attempt' at covering up this lie..."}]
