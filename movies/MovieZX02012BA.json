Vera, however, does not appear startled at all, looking at the leading Kurono Construct with disdain."},{"T":"301","2":"Kurono Construct","3":"Your operation has been terminated. Put down your weapons and follow our orders.

We understand."},{"T":"301","3":"It is not like her to follow orders. Noticing that, No. 21 does not question any further. Noctis, grumpy as he is, also detects it and remains silent.

You want to ask about Kurono's plan for you after this, but it is evidently futile, considering the faceless, armed figures standing before you."},{"T":"301","3":"In this brief moment of respite, the gears in your brain start turning."},{"T":"301","3":"Kurono's mission has clearly not been locating Luna. They picked this town, and your reactions were part of their plan."},{"T":"301","3":"Remembering Luna's memories..."},{"T":"302","2":"(Because I entered her M.I.N.D.)","4":"(Because of the memory replays.)"},{"T":"301","3":"Kurono has been suspecting it. They are trying to gather evidence."},{"T":"301","3":"Kurono seems to know everything about you."},{"T":"301","3":"If they compare the visual data during a connection, Kurono can easily deduce that you might have been 'stained' by Luna's memories somehow."},{"T":"301","3":"Not that you can control those memory replays anyway..."},{"T":"302","2":"(Their target is Luna's memories?)","4":"(Their target is... me?)"},{"T":"301","3":"No... Even if you have indeed imported her memories, it is still impossible to extract a Construct's memory from a human brain."},{"T":"301","3":"They are ambitious, that is for sure."},{"T":"301","3":"You still have so many questions regarding this operation. The Ascendant that has been guiding Roland... was it an accident that she ran into Cerberus? Vera knows more than she has been letting on."},{"T":"301","3":"Did Luna really go there after that battle? Then who was fighting her? Ever since you entered the town, those hallucinations became clearer and clearer. What is the connection between them?"},{"T":"301","3":"Countless questions occupy your mind. At the very least, the most important one is answered."},{"T":"301","3":"Tiredness overcomes you."},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia... Liv, Lee..."},{"T":"301","3":"You place your hands back on the table. There is a slight ping, and you think you can feel the wind\u2014which is impossible in a sealed room."},{"T":"301","3":"That illusory breeze is gone soon enough. It passes through the heavy bulletproof glass and the seven-centimeter-thick metal walls, and it heads outside."},{"T":"301","3":"It passed the withered tree and the lifeless houses over the nameless graves full of white crosses. An insignificant white daisy on the edge of the grave sways, hoping the wind will carry it away, but the wind cannot."},{"T":"301","3":"The wind turns and heads up. The town grows smaller and smaller in its vision; the past is but a speck of dust in the tides of time. It is but a small inscription in the labyrinth."},{"T":"301","3":"The town is but a blinking signal 30,000 feet above in the air."},{"T":"301","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"World Government Operation Logistics Center."},{"T":"301","2":"Operation Leader","3":"Commander."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Speak."},{"T":"301","2":"Operation Leader","3":"Encrypted channel, storage module 3-302X."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"You found it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Operation Leader","3":"We found it.
