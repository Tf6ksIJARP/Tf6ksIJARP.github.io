Where are the folks who were in this carriage?"},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"I've placed most of them in other cities' conservation areas before meeting up with the Forsaken."},{"T":"301","3":"Jamilah sits on her chair elegantly, her expression unfazed, as though she has long been used to confronting danger."},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"Still, some of them refused to leave despite the situation, and you have witnessed their fate."},{"T":"301","2":"Middle-aged Refugee","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"The refugee immediately returns to his seat after that."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"Akdilek has suffered a great loss in this rescue. After this is over, the Forsaken will not forget what you have done."},{"T":"301","3":"Also a leader himself, Watanabe, however, just looks exhausted."},{"T":"301","3":"Everyone the Forsaken has taken in has witnessed the torments that Watanabe and the Forsaken went through."},{"T":"301","3":"The pain has long past what one could reasonably bear. Yet the Forsaken are still standing here, like a lighthouse in the storm, unyielding in their oath to not leave anyone behind."},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"Don't worry about that. We're here because I have my own considerations and plans."},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"With what has transpired, no one gets to remain uninvolved.

It's clear that we can't outrun them, and we can't win by attrition."},{"T":"301","2":"Shrek","3":"I might just be a civilian, and I'm grateful to be saved, but both the folks behind us and I can't bear to lose any more of you."},{"T":"301","3":"Hearing that, a corner of Jamilah's mouth ever so subtly rises."},{"T":"301","2":"Shrek","3":"Especially you, Watanabe.

I just received a message\u2014the Operational Command is preparing Phase Two of the prototype, and they're planning to drop it tomorrow."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"With the improvements they've made, this Omega Weapon can create a small disinfected area, drawing in the Punishing Virus within."},{"T":"301","3":"Hearing that, everyone's solemn face relaxes a little."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"But its effectiveness is still inconclusive. We should prepare a backup plan."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"Have you confirmed the exact timing and location?"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"I have. We need to arrive at the station in City 210 by 4 o'clock tomorrow. There, we will receive the new prototype."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"Must it be City 210 and 4 o'clock? That's cutting it real close."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"We need to take into account the time needed to depart and meet up with the Support Force. We must hurry and put some distance between the enemy and us."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Not to mention that... it's too dangerous for the civilians to remain on the train. There is another functional base in City 210. People can get off there."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"It's more than enough if we just keep a small force of combatants here to draw the twins' attention."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"This is why reaching City 210 by 4 o'clock tomorrow seems reasonable."},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"I suppose we have to speed up."},{"T":"301","3":"Jamilah smiles, her gaze passing each of those discussing the plan until it stops at Shrek in the back."},{"T":"301","3":"Through the sound of their discussion, she sends Shrek a message, speaking silently."},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"W-e-l-c-o-m-e-b-a-c-k..."},{"T":"301","2":"Shrek","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Sophia","3":"I'll go help."},{"T":"301","3":"Given how dire the situation is, the Constructs have not noticed the expressions of the two humans, not to mention what Jamilah was saying."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"Then we'll stay here to take care of the minions."},{"T":"301","3":"The boy's fist connects with a Corrupted that is clinging to the broken edge, snapping its neck."},{"T":"301","3":"\u2014But it only falls into the crowd of Corrupted behind, still in pursuit."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"Back together again?
