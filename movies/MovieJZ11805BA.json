[{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Well, we're about to enter the CPF area. You can take off the protective mask now."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"Wanshi takes off the protective mask that Kamui handed over to him earlier. The air pours into his nose while the wind high above sweeps across Wanshi."},{"T":"301","3":"It is different from the artificial touch of the simulation experience hall in Babylonia, but a brand new element from the Earth that he has never experienced before."},{"T":"301","3":"Wanshi steps into a city under reconstruction with Kamui. Most of the buildings are dilapidated, but the CPF has started running again. Several teams of Constructs move beneath the CPF working on reconstruction."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"How are you feeling?"},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Well... it's a fresh experience, but nothing special."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"At least it's better than being stuck in the same place."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Haha, it's rare for them to send humans to the ground. Make good use of it."},{"T":"301","3":"Kamui smiled and jumped down."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"What? Wait..."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Just jump down, I'll catch you."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"...No need. I'll do it myself."},{"T":"301","3":"Wanshi stands there and sighs, looking for the right landing spot on the wall and slowly moves toward the ground."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Sorry to keep you waiting. I'm back."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Construct","3":"Well, get ready for the next battle."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Construct","3":"...Huh? Why is there a human behind you?"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Ah, it's Wanshi, the authorities send him here to help us."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"He's not just any doctor, but a pretty good one."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"He fixed me even though I was severely injured back then."},{"T":"301","3":"The slightly older Construct looks at the smirking Kamui, then turns to the nervous Wanshi."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Construct","3":"Wanshi... so you're the student of that professor."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Do you... know him?"},{"T":"301","2":"Old Construct","3":"Well, he spoke highly and had high hopes for you."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Construct","3":"But I never thought he'd eventually die of overwork. You must be quite stressed in the Star of Life."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Die of overwork..."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Construct","3":"Enough of that. The defense of City 157 nearby is about to be broken through. The Corrupted could reach us at any time."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Construct","3":"Wanshi, if City 157 falls, you should hide in the shelter around the CPF..."},{"T":"301","3":"The old Construct's words are covered by a huge explosion from the south.

You, go cover the doctor."},{"T":"301","2":"Construct D","3":"Roger!"},{"T":"301","3":"Constructs that have received the orders immediately go into action. A Construct drags Wanshi toward the CPF quickly and pushes him into a relatively solid building."},{"T":"301","2":"Construct D","3":"Doctor, just stay here."},{"T":"301","3":"After that, the Construct pats Wanshi on the shoulder. Then he takes out the weapon and runs toward the front of the defense line."},{"T":"301","3":"The sounds of explosion from time to time soon turns into a noisy and turbulent firefight."},{"T":"301","3":"Several Corrupted have even crossed the defense line deployed earlier and enter the street near the CPF."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"So this is the surface... the battlefield where the Constructs fight in..."},{"T":"301","3":"A grenade flies out of the crowd of the Corrupted and explodes at the foot of the CPF."},{"T":"301","3":"The impact knocks Wanshi to the ground."},{"T":"301","3":"Wanshi has only heard the description of dying from the wounded soldiers. Now everything is happening right here."},{"T":"301","3":"The towering building collapses under fire, burying the Constructs and Corrupted underneath it."},{"T":"301","3":"One of the Construct's ankle sinks into the cracked ground. A moment's pause leaves him under siege from a large number of Corrupted around. The Construct beside him comes to support, only to be caught in the crowd of the Corrupted."},{"T":"301","3":"Fire and explosions are everywhere. Vital fluid is mixed with oil, flowing between the craters on the ground."},{"T":"301","3":"Smoke pours into Wanshi's airway, the intense physical discomfort making him cough violently."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Cough\u2014cough\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"The remains of the Corrupted keeps piling up in the areas where the Constructs passed. But more Corrupted continue to flood in from the horizon."},{"T":"301","3":"Endless despair fills the battleground. Humans created the Constructs and used wars to proclaim sovereignty over Earth. Yet most human beings do not even understand what war means, just like Wanshi in the past."},{"T":"301","3":"Wanshi wipes the smoke and dust that has filled his eyes with his hand. A Construct is standing in front him, pulling the debris of the grenade from his body and throwing them to the ground."},{"T":"301","3":"Wanshi can vaguely recognize the mark of Support Construct through his torn armband."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"!"},{"T":"301","2":"Support Construct A","3":"It's a pity. I've just fixed my artificial skin."},{"T":"301","2":"Support Construct A","3":"But it would be no joke if the grenade hit a human."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Aren't you a Support Construct?
