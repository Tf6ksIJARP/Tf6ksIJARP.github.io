Every time, they ended up in Lamia and Roland's way, even in the areas where there was nothing to infest."},{"T":"301","3":"Like every time in the past, the small number of Corrupted do not pose any threat.

I thought we were just lost...)"},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"Eek\u2014!"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Whoever is behind them, I have no idea what they want... Are they just testing us?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"(Not necessarily. They should have sent stronger forces to test us. Maybe they just wanted to change our route, so they sent those Corrupted in the hope that we would avoid them.)"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"(Better ask Lamia to control them if they ever show up again. I can't let her know that I've lost control of the Corrupted.)"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Alright, let's kill them all!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"?"},{"T":"301","3":"Roland still doesn't know why his opponent sent in these soulless weaklings, but he has no time to waste on them."},{"T":"301","3":"Roland has a plan in mind.

But if the opponents can control Corrupted, they are probably no different."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland?","3":"They are definitely aware that such trivial attack are never going to pose any threat.

Are we really going after them?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Actually, I think we are pretty lucky. They are already looking for us before we go after them.

In fact, he is expecting it\u2014"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"...Is that it?"},{"T":"301","3":"Roland and Lamia follow the sound, until it goes low in a particular direction, then becomes almost inaudible."},{"T":"301","3":"They continue heading in that direction, and finally arrive at the destination after climbing over a couple of building ruins."},{"T":"301","3":"They see a transport aircraft with Babylonia signs parked between the collapsed buildings."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"Eek... This is a Babylonia aircraft, right? Why is it here alone?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Since it has come here alone, it is probably not carrying supplies or equipment, but\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"They see three busy-working figures at a crossing further away."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Task Force members on a mission."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"What the hell are you two doing?"},{"T":"301","3":"Breaking the silence, Vera closes the holo-projection on her terminal and turns to face her two teammates nearby."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"It's a door!

No, it can't be."},{"T":"301","3":"Roland soon dispels the idea from his mind after thinking about that female."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"'She' doesn't look like the type of agent that would attract Babylonia's attention."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Could it be us then...? No, I don't think so. We haven't done anything. The last time we exposed ourselves, we were with 'her'..."},{"T":"301","3":"Rationally, Roland knows he should stay away from the Task Force as they have no conflicts of interest with him, especially when his main mission isn't going anywhere."},{"T":"301","3":"But the Task Force must be sent here for some reason.

Time for you to shine. Go eavesdrop on them, and find out what they are here for."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"Eek... Me?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"I can't go stealth like you."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"Um... Alright."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Perhaps they've transferred Murray to the Hellhounds.

You're screwing with me, aren't you?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Ha... That's an improvement. At least you understand irony now. Alright, let's stop complaining\u2014we have the Gray Raven Commandant with us."},{"T":"301","2":"No. 21","3":"I don't like it."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"A mission is a mission, 21.

A rock!"},{"T":"301","3":"Even with a rein on her waist, Lamia manages to jump over a rock with incredible dexterity."},{"T":"301","3":"But the old cart she is pulling isn't so lucky.
