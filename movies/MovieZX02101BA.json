Nikola takes a look around the room and frowns."},{"T":"301","3":"Velvet curtains? A chandelier? The long Black Walnut table? These are all trinkets from ages ago.

It's been so long! Take a seat and we'll catch up."},{"T":"301","3":"Collins gestures to Nikola with a 'please' motion, his tone frivolous and comical as if he is still speaking to his subordinate from Kurono instead of the Chief Commander of Babylonia."},{"T":"301","3":"Not hiding his displeasure, Nikola sits down on the other side of the long table regardless."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"I'm not here to catch up, Collins. What Kurono has been doing to \u3010kuroname\u3011 has crossed the Parliament's line."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"P for Parliament, or P for President, huh?"},{"T":"301","3":"Collins savors every word he says."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola's silence makes Collins laugh."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Times are a-changin', and we're now playing in space instead of on earth. Folks like us manage to live this long because we know the rules, and we follow them, and long before this mess started, we made them."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Don't lump me in with you."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"True. You've thrown away your past for a spot on the front stage as the dazzling Chief Commander, the boss soldier of Earth's forces... but you and I both know that a person's nature is determined by their upbringings."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"You can't bury who you were.

In this room, nonetheless!"},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Don't tell me you just want to condemn Kurono's actions with a serious speech."},{"T":"301","3":"Before Nikola can react, Collins has already interrupted him."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Sure, I invited you, but you were the one who accepted the invitation!

Why are you acting like a stranger, dear Nicky?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"I've turned a blind eye within my authority as much as I could regarding you detaining a Task Force commandant."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Understand this\u2014I can take away your clearance any moment if I want. Kurono is a shadow that can't go into the light. You wouldn't want your dirty laundry hidden all these years exposed in the sun, would you?"},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Nah, you won't do that. We've surely passed the bluffing stage by now, Nicky! You won't go back on your word before you've gotten what you want."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Your president is sentimental, but not you. The Gray Raven Commandant is just leverage to you, no more important than any other commandant you got. You aren't going to war to get one person back, because you don't care."},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola makes a light grumble."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"You bet your leverage on the right table instead of giving it away when you know everyone has their eye on it."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"My inaction and passiveness on this matter have caused Hassen's grievance. I have no interest in an open conflict with him."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"See, I like talking to you because you put logic before your feelings! Unlike your President Hassen and his crocodile tears."},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola's expression shifts for a second."},{"T":"301","3":"Collins does not notice it, however."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"You have no more clearance to hold onto our commandant. Even if I were willing to look the other way, neither the public nor the soldiers on the frontline would tolerate it much longer."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"You're locking up the person who defeated the Polyphage. The Gray Raven Commandant has become the symbol of 'hope' to the public. They're more likely to believe someone they can see instead of your made-up accusations."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"That's why I said you crossed 'the Parliament's line'\u2014not every member gives a damn about the Gray Raven Commandant, but they all care about the Parliament's authority and image to the people."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"You've contained \u3010kuroname\u3011 in the name of 'confined treatment' for way too long."},{"T":"301","3":"Collins shakes his head."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Not long enough. I still haven't found what I was looking for. 'Confined treatment' is nowhere near enough."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"I can't understand what your obsession is with a human commandant."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Nah-ah-ah\u2014Nicky, you know damn well what it is."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola remains silent as Collins claps his hands, satisfied."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Enough with the bullshit. I want to assign the Gray Raven Commandant on a mission."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"We've detected Luna's M.I.N.D. activity on the surface. We need the commandant to track her whereabouts."},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola's fists tighten.

She usually keeps hers pretty damn well hidden, but we caught a glimpse last time when the Polyphage was having her for dinner."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"We've detected its signature again, and this time, we need the Gray Raven Commandant to track it and find Luna for us."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"You don't have the clearance. \u3010kuroname\u3011 is part of the military's Task Force. The commandant's assignments must be appointed through the system in the Operation Logistics Center."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Which is why you're here, Nicky! A little clearance isn't going to stop our Chief Commander, am I right?"},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. Then he denies Collins' request staunchly."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"As you said, I'm the Chief Commander. I cannot treat our rules as non-existent."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"We spent so much effort rebuilding laws and orders in the world after the apocalypse. They're the framework upon which the world progresses forward."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Break the rule once, and you put a crack in the dam. It won't be long before it crumbles down and all hell breaks loose."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"You're starting to sound like your hypocritic president."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"But I know the truth. This is just my dear Nicky putting up a show. You don't give a shit about any of this."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Neither you nor I am satisfied with maintaining this brief stability of the status quo."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"To be backed into a corner... This stability is just the calmness inside a coffin. Your ambition lies beyond this, no? Isn't finding a new way forward for humanity and destroying this false serenity what you've wanted?"},{"T":"301","3":"Collins takes out a folder from a hidden compartment underneath the table as he speaks."},{"T":"301","3":"It is an old, brown paper bag, its edges so worn down over time that it looks like it will fall apart upon touch."},{"T":"301","3":"Collins throws it onto the table before him carelessly, however. The scent of rotting paper fills the room."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Besides, I've found what you've been searching for all this time, dear Nicky."},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola's gaze freezes when it reaches the words on the paper bag, and his pupils shrink slightly."},{"T":"301","3":"Stamped in red on the bag is the phrase 'TOP SECRET'."},{"T":"301","3":"Difficult to catalog and transmit, physical means of delivering information have been abandoned by humans for the last hundred years, ever since entering the Information Age."},{"T":"301","3":"Except for classified information. Most people choose paper to back up their secrets unanimously."},{"T":"301","3":"Digitized information is easy to leak, and hard disks and CD-ROMs have a much shorter lifespan than paper. The shortcomings of a piece of paper are strengths when it comes to keeping classified intel."},{"T":"301","3":"Staring at the date on the corner of the paper bag, Nikola subconsciously reaches for it."},{"T":"301","3":"But right as he is about to touch it, a finger presses down on a corner of the bag, holding it there."},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola's eyes shift up from Collins' finger to his face."},{"T":"301","3":"The slight raise of the corner of Collins' mouth reminds Nikola of how he must have looked right now."},{"T":"301","3":"Quietly, his hand withdraws from the bag."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"As I said, I cannot break the rules."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"The Gray Raven Commandant's assignments must be given through the Operation Logistics Center with an official Construct squad. The mission details must also be officially approved and logged."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Then we'll make it 'official,' just the way you like."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"From what I've heard, you've got a Task Force directly under you called Cerberus. It's a remotely connected team\u2014very experimental stuff\u2014and its captain is a Construct from Kurono..."},{"T":"301","3":"Before he finishes, Collins gently lifts a corner of the bag with his finger as if showcasing his trophy before Nikola."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"The silence brews."},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola thinks for a moment before coming to a decision."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"I'll transfer the authority to assign Cerberus to the Operations Logistics Center. The Gray Raven Commandant can be deployed alongside this squad."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"You can send one of yours to oversee the operation, but find someone with a cleaner resume. I don't want people complaining, and I don't want... too much noise made."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Just this once."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"When it's over, everything goes back to where they belong, including the commandant."},{"T":"301","3":"Satisfied with the answer he receives, Collins pushes the folder in his hand to the other side of the table before Nikola."},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola picks up the paper bag, standing up and ready to leave."},{"T":"301","3":"Collins stops him once more."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"What's still in that Golden Age trash that gets you all nervous? I had my technicians analyze it, but it's just some experiment data from the Science Council a few years before the Virus destroyed everything."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Dug up from the ruins by some guy, took a trip through the black market before ending up at Daedalus, only to be recycled by us... Things like this are a dime a dozen."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"They might have been top secrets and cutting-edge technologies back in the day, but they are as useful as a piece of paper in a time like this when everything has to start over from scratch."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"I'm just so damn curious. What's inside this that gets our Nicky here all obsessed?"},{"T":"301","3":"Before Nikola answers, Collins puts a finger to his mouth in a 'hush' gesture."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"You don't have to say anything. Soon, we\u2014will\u2014all\u2014find out."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"As long as we're on this ship together, nothing will remain a secret forever."},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola tilts his head."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"If that's the case, then everything about Kurono will not remain hidden forever as well."},{"T":"301","3":"Collins ignores him, and Nikola steps outside the room."},{"T":"301","3":"The door closes behind him."},{"T":"301","3":"Babylonia, 12 hours before Cerberus receives their mission."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"I've brought the thing back."},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola throws the paper bag he got from Collins not too long ago before Hassen."},{"T":"301","3":"Hassen catches it, and he immediately takes out the data from the bag and reads it carefully."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Did Collins notice?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"No, I don't think he knew. He thought we disagreed, and I was giving him the Gray Raven Commandant behind your back."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"I'm surprised too. I thought you'd reject me when I proposed this. You seem to value the commandant a lot, after all."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Valuing \u3010kuroname\u3011 doesn't mean I'll stay in a stalemate with Kurono forever. Getting stuck in an arm-wrestle helps nobody."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Not to mention, they've been acting desperate. Being high-profile and blatant isn't their MO."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"I'm worried that Collins has got his hands on something big\u2014something important enough that gives him leverage to escalate like this."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"They said they needed \u3010kuroname\u3011 to help track down an Ascendant, but given the way and the number of people they're deploying, do you think they're truly hunting an Ascendant?"},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Collins has his eyes set on \u3010kuroname\u3011 right now, which means \u3010kuroname\u3011 must be an important part of their plans... Connect the dots, and what do you think we'll find?"},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola's expression turns gradually more solemn as Hassen speaks."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Something that's connected to \u3010kuroname\u3011 at this point in time... Are you saying that what they're after is\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola does not need to name 'what they're after' as he already knows the answer from Hassen's eyes."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Indeed. It's exactly what you think."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Of course, it's only my guess."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Regardless, we can't prove that they've got ahold of 'her.' Not to mention that we have no idea what they need 'her' for."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"We need to know what this all means, so we must act."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"You were our best option. If I 'compromised' on the Gray Raven Commandant, Collins might figure out that something is afoot."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"But not me... is that so?"},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Exactly. Your past makes him less cautious, and our usual 'disagreements' has provided our plan the best cover."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"I always think that you are more cold and logical than me in some ways."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"But I have to warn you\u2014Collins is not a fool. Even if he didn't notice at first, the moment I revealed my interest in that data, he knew what a trump card he got in his hand."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"He must have had a backup made before giving me the original file."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"I'm sure he had, but it doesn't matter."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Collins' data is incomplete. He doesn't know the more crucial information hidden behind this file."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"And you're certain this intel will bring us what we want?"},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"I'm certain."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"To avoid suspicion, we had Murray retrieve a piece of information from Gestalt when Huaxu hacked it."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"That information isn't complete, and neither is the one in Collins' hand."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"It appears to be a report on the zero-point reactor."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"It is."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"These files are the regular data feedback sent to the Science Council by each reactor."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"But we've discovered that the data reported by one of the reactors is slightly different.

Because our information was incomplete, we only managed to get the latitude and the altitude of the reactor."},{"T":"301","3":"Hassen waves the folder in his hand."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"We deduced that the longitude is hidden in reports during the same period of time, which ended up being the one that fell into Collins' lap."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"...I don't understand. Why would someone encrypt the location of their own reactor, only to send that information out?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"This is like the work of a..."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"A spy."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"You're right."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"The World Government was well established at that point. There were no borders or separate governments\u2014why would someone from the Golden Age try to leak this information?"},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Just because there was only one government didn't mean that there were no disagreements."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Zero-point reactors represented the next energy revolution.
