[{"T":"301","2":"Corrupted","3":"Rargh\u2014!!! Argh!!"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Ahhhhhhh... Help!"},{"T":"301","3":"The hiss of the Corrupted entwines with the young girl's scream. Encountering Corrupted in a dark and narrow underground passage was akin to falling prey to a hunter's trap. In other words\u2014there is no escape."},{"T":"301","3":"But the strange thing is that the girl's scream seems stiff... and almost indifferent."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Is that what the protagonist sounds like when she encounters a monster in a story? Words on a page do little justice\u2026"},{"T":"301","3":"The girl closes the digital file on the miniature holo-screen in her hand, then a comically large chainsaw for her slender figure appears in its place."},{"T":"301","2":"Corrupted","3":"Rargh!!!!!"},{"T":"301","3":"The mindless Corrupted continues to roar, oblivious to the change in persona of the girl standing before it."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"BABY\u2014YOU'RE\u2014A\u2014FIREWORK\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"The girl shouts as she sends the Corrupted flying into the air with her giant chainsaw. The poor Corrupted smashes through the ceiling and blasts off at the speed of light."},{"T":"301","3":"Long awaited sunlight shines through the hole in the ceiling\u2014finally shedding light on the slender girl, Nanami."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"What's this? Looks like the Corrupted dropped something..."},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami picks up a red envelope from the pile of scraps left by the Corrupted."},{"T":"301","3":"She looks it over for some time, but she is unable to surmise anything noteworthy. So, she stuffs it into her jacket."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"What a drag... I've looked everywhere, but I can't find anyone to talk to."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"I guess I'll make up a reason to go to Babylonia and hang out with the commandant..."},{"T":"301","3":"Right at that moment, Nanami, leaning on her chainsaw in a strange posture, glances around the underground passage as glittering lights approach her."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Huh? What are they! Corrupted...? No, they can't be..."},{"T":"301","3":"She tiptoes into the darkness, overcome with curiosity."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Meow\u2014! Meow\u2014!"},{"T":"301","3":"She knows they aren't cats, but she still continues to meow in an attempt to sooth the peculiar creatures."},{"T":"301","3":"As she gets closer, the glittering lights rustle in the darkness and slowly approach her."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Huh...? You're..."},{"T":"301","3":"Through the sunlight, Nanami sees that the lights are all coming from excavation mechanoids."},{"T":"301","3":"The mechanoids all have the same bright red coating, which was a rare sight to see."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Aw, look at you cuties!"},{"T":"301","3":"More lights appear throughout the underground passage, surrounding Nanami in a far greater number than anticipated."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Huh? Are you trying... to attack me? Bring it on! I'm not afraid of you!"},{"T":"301","3":"However, the mechanoids show no intention of attacking. Instead, they only rub up against her."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Are you... thanking me for defeating that Corrupted? Doesn't seem like purely logical behavior..."},{"T":"301","3":"A few mechanoids crawl onto Nanami in excitement."},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami looks down to see that the mechanoids seem to be showing a liking to the red envelope that was dropped by the Corrupted."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"That's strange... Why do you guys like this so much?"},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami can vaguely feel that although these machines are not sentient, they have begun to develop a hive mentality."},{"T":"301","3":"She pats the mechanoids, trying to sense their will."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"You guys are too weak and primitive... Whether that be mentally or physically."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"If no one protects you, you won't stand a snowball's chance in hell against even just one of those Corrupted..."},{"T":"301","3":"\u2014Who should lead them?"},{"T":"301","3":"\u2014Is there only one right way forward?"},{"T":"301","3":"\u2014The only way to create something from nothing, is..."},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami gradually comes to a halt, leaving only the consciousness of mechanoids dispersing outward."},{"T":"301","3":"The mechanoids sense a fluctuation in Nanami's consciousness, then instinctively flee like an avalanche from unknown danger."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Hey! Ahhhhh!!!"},{"T":"301","3":"After coming back to her senses, she cries out in regret as she sees the mechanoids disperse."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Where are you going! HEY!!!"},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami searches every nook and cranny of the underground passage, but the mechanoids have already left without a trace. Seems like they're a lot more skilled at hiding than anticipated."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"You're starting to piss me off! I'm not gonna give up that easily!"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"I'll think of a way to find you... You little..."},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami suddenly realizes that the mechanoids have not had a name, but quickly comes up with a nickname."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"I got it! I'll call you 'Xi'! Alright, it's decided! I'm gonna catch you Xis, then we'll have fun\u2026"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"But I don't even know where they are hiding... I'll have to come up with a way to smoke 'em out..."},{"T":"301","3":"Looking at the red envelope on the ground, a lightbulb appears to go off in her head."}]
