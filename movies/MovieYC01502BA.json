[{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Gabriel, do you think Miss Luna has been acting quite strange recently?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"She's even appearing on the battlefield."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Our leader appearing on the battlefield boosts troop morale. It shouldn't be considered strange."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Forget it..."},{"T":"301","3":"With that, Roland picks up a stone and chucks it at a tree behind him."},{"T":"301","3":"The stone, however, does not connect with the tree. Instead, it stops midair."},{"T":"301","3":"Then, slowly, a hand grows out of the stone, slowly corporealizing into a body. Arm, torso, until the figure reveals itself coiling around the tree with several legs."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"Eeek...! Watch out! Why'd you throw at me!"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Reminds me, can she really handle it all by herself?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"I-I guess...? She said we don't have to provide her with any support. We can just withdraw once we complete our mission..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"...Sounds like something she'd say."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"You spend more time with Miss Luna than we do, don't you find it a bit off?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"N-no, not really... But I guess Miss Luna has been spending more time by herself than usual..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"And you still don't find it strange, huh..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"B-but Miss Luna and Miss Alpha are just the same as ever..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"...Oh, you're just\u2014Sigh."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"I had you keep an eye on 'her.' Any news?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"Uh, well... You got nothing with a direct confrontation. What makes you think I'd have any updates..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"...'She' seems to be traveling aimlessly as usual."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"...That's the dog that didn't bark, dear Watson."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Based on the signal we recently sent out in South America, 'she' seems to be acting as if nothing happened."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Maybe she didn't catch the news."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"As you know, ground relay is slower than it used to be."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Is there any possibility... that we've all been gravely mistaken?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"What if 'she' doesn't really care?"},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"If so, then 'she' is by no means a good agent."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Who stipulated that an agent must be loyal to their duty? Do you even know how agents are created?"},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel & Lamia","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Look, even WE don't know. Non-agents know nothing about agents."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"That's the issue."},{"T":"301","3":"Roland is about to continue, when Lamia points off into the distance."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"I-it's beginning..."},{"T":"301","3":"Roland and Gabriel look to where Lamia is pointing and see the Arctic Route Union surrounded by an explosion of fire and smoke."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"What's going on...? Wouldn't forcing them away achieve her goal already?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"Miss Luna... is trying to bring destruction upon them all."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"This does not bode well. We've revealed our hand too early..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"All while Babylonia and 'she' still have their hands covered, we're forced to be on the passive."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Let us wait and consult with Miss Luna when she returns. Perhaps we no longer need to lurk in the dark."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Maybe, just maybe..."},{"T":"301","2":"'421'","3":"So, are you still going to side with them?"},{"T":"301","3":"Shadows outstretched, the room is bathed in darkness. The robot looks over at a mysterious figure standing half-illuminated before it."},{"T":"301","3":"The shadowy figure lights a fire, leaving a fiery dot in the darkness, trailing with a puff of white smoke."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Indeed. This is all quite amusing."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"And with the addition of Huaxu, this has become... all the more interesting."},{"T":"301","2":"'421'","3":"If only I hadn't spared your life."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"I'd say the same thing if I were you."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"I'm sure me being alive has been quite the thorn in your side."},{"T":"301","2":"'421'","3":"But as you know, I've never really cared about it. You're still of use to me now."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Useful to you? Or do you mean the two old guys above you?"},{"T":"301","2":"'421'","3":"You know I can't answer you that."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Never expected you to anyways."},{"T":"301","2":"'421'","3":"So, what's with 'Huaxu'?"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"What information do you have in exchange?"},{"T":"301","2":"'421'","3":"Enough intel to keep you away from the tip of Babylonia's spear in the coming days."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Fair enough. Let me ask you this... What purpose does 'Huaxu' serve?"},{"T":"301","2":"'421'","3":"'Huaxu' is an AI. As for its purpose, that is for its owner to decide."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"You're right. My point is, Huaxu may have a new master, but has her master... really changed?"},{"T":"301","3":"The shadowy figure shakes their head and nods. The mechanical joints in their hands clench and loose. Finally, a few chuckles slide out of the speaker."},{"T":"301","2":"'421'","3":"So... The plot thickens."},{"T":"301","2":"'421'","3":"Last question\u2014how big of a piece do you want of the pie?"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Who said I only wanted a piece?
