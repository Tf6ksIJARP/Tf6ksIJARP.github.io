There's something I want you to keep."},{"T":"301","3":"Watanabe turns on the automatic pilot and turns to throw you a jacket."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"This jacket works much better in a desert than the uniform you're wearing."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"What's with the face? Relax, it's just a jacket."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"Do you have really good memories, or do you just hold a massive grudge?"},{"T":"302","2":"Huh, it doesn't come with mint leaves this time.","4":"Can't it be both?"},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"...Good memories, then."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"I'll give you the mint leaves next time."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"Anyway, stay alert. We're not far from the next outpost."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"By the way, the jacket comes with a Forsaken locator.
