Not again?!"},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami lands on her face, and her running chainsaw flies from her hand to the side of a group of repair programs. They just mechanically pull the chainsaw out, and then thoroughly repair the cracked floor."},{"T":"301","3":"Climbing up, Nanami readjusts her frame's sensory input again before picking up her weapon. She carefully taps the head of one of the programs, and it pays her no attention."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"No reaction at all... I bet only the programs in the anomaly behave so strangely."},{"T":"301","3":"She wears the chainsaw on her back and tries to recollect what just happened inside the anomaly."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"It's obviously not normal for the programs to develop self-awareness.
