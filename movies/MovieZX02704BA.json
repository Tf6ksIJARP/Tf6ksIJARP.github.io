Is it because of 'commands'? Haicma quickly rejects this hypothesis as her massive database shows that there has never been a command that can make a human 'absolutely obedient.'"},{"T":"301","3":"Is it their 'essence,' then? Just like how machines act according to their underlying protocols, perhaps humans also act according to a similar core principle."},{"T":"301","3":"Even when they are different beings with different experiences, these people all make the same choice at that particular moment.

The massive data stream threatens to drown her, clutching onto her like pairs of desperate hands."},{"T":"301","3":"Her white coat begins to turn red as despairing cries blur the line between the virtual world and reality. Sparks fly from the back of her exposed head as the integration module runs at a dangerous speed."},{"T":"301","3":"The temperature of her frame has long risen past the safety threshold.

Good job!"},{"T":"301","3":"Haicma gently claps her hands according to her personality profile."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"Is there somewhere you want to go?"},{"T":"301","2":"Renee","3":"My name is... Renee... Mr. Soldier told me about a refuge..."},{"T":"301","3":"Haicma does not have to ask where this soldier is.

Ignoring the fact that there might not be any qualified technicians among the refugees, it is simply not a good idea to keep a machine around that can get infected."},{"T":"301","3":"Haicma has done countless calculations, and the conclusion is the same.
