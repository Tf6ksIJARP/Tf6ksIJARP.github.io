I don't have much time."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"I know what you've done to Power, and I've picked up on all the signals.

Still, Nanami can detect breathing and life signals in him."},{"T":"301","2":"Man-In-Black","3":"You could say that."},{"T":"301","3":"The man puts down his arms. His cloak moves slightly with his action, showing the battery of the vital circulatory device on his waist\u2014he seems to have had a bad wound. Now he is a half-mechanoid."},{"T":"301","2":"Man-In-Black","3":"I saw you in the fortress, taking so much attack without a scratch. Nanami, the powerful leader of the machines. Is that right?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"I wasn't aware of what happened back then... So..."},{"T":"301","2":"Man-In-Black","3":"I understand that you were scared, and I won't blame you for that. After all, as leader of the machines, you know better than anyone else... what the machines have done to humankind."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Believe it or not... but this isn't at all what I hoped to see. Since you're from the human side, could you just help me spread this message..."},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami stops cold\u2014she knows that a mere message will achieve nothing if they do nothing to change the situation. The machines will just keep fighting, and humans will just fight back, too."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"...It was me... I failed."},{"T":"301","2":"Man-In-Black","3":"Great minds think alike.

Let's see."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"WGAA wasn't able to evacuate in time, trying to rescue all the Golden Age relics when the machines invaded Babylonia.

As sudden as the orders are, they are chalked up as Sage's eccentricity."},{"T":"301","3":"Unable to think up an effective plan, Nanami resorts to organizing a gathering as a way to minimize the number of machines heading onto the battlefield. There is, however, no telling if this is going to hold the army back for real."},{"T":"301","3":"But that is something she can figure out on a different day, as long as this plan buys the remaining humans enough time to evacuate."},{"T":"301","3":"On the other hand, Haicma and Spooner are doing what Nanami has told them to."},{"T":"301","3":"Carrying the crowned Sage, a giant robot slowly makes its way down the central aisle of the plaza, flanked by an orderly line of loyal 'Gear' soldiers on both sides."},{"T":"301","3":"The machines kneel to the ground and press their chest against the cold snow, extending their arms toward Nanami. The sun is descending into the horizon behind her."},{"T":"301","3":"This is not unlike a human pilgrimage."},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami notices that she is the only one still standing in the enormous plaza."},{"T":"301","3":"Trembling, the sun over the horizon descends no more. The sky grows darker still, eventually erasing the last trace of light from sight with what seems to be all of the world's clouds."},{"T":"301","3":"With the pitch-black sky hanging over them and maintaining their prostrating posture, the mechanoids begin chanting away in a low hum. Saturating the air, the rhythmic chant repeats one phrase over and over:"},{"T":"301","3":"'Sagemachina.'"},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami is engrossed by the solemn yet odd scene."},{"T":"301","3":"Staring at her surrounding, she hears her own voice speaking."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Is this all?"},{"T":"301","2":"Zero","3":"It is, but if you find it lacking, we shall double this number in one night."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"...That is... very impressive."},{"T":"301","2":"Zero","3":"So long as you're pleased, Sage!"},{"T":"301","3":"The red mechanoid girl's eyes are glowing with excitement."},{"T":"301","2":"Zero","3":"I didn't have much time to prepare for the ceremony you asked.

Moments later, the mechanoids are all infected."},{"T":"301","3":"Then, the Corrupted lured around the fort beforehand storm in, crushing humanity's line of defense."},{"T":"301","3":"Following bursts of fireworks, the plaza is drowned in exhilarated cheers."},{"T":"301","3":"A flying mechanoid hands a lucid red diamond over to Zero.
