[{"T":"301","2":"Director","3":"Why are you all banged up?"},{"T":"301","2":"Director","3":"Sigh..."},{"T":"301","3":"The director wants to scold Changyu, but all he can muster up is a sigh."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"I just had a run-in with some thugs... No big deal."},{"T":"301","3":"Changyu replies and looks around the theater. Laoyu is sitting at a table off to the side with Yusheng, who he had not seen for some time."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"...Yusheng! Where have you been all this time?"},{"T":"301","3":"Changyu perks up with a smile, surprised at the sight of seeing a familiar face after so long."},{"T":"301","2":"Yusheng","3":"I had some family matters to attend to, so..."},{"T":"301","3":"Yusheng rubs his fingers. His once immaculate white hands are now wrapped in bandages."},{"T":"301","2":"Yusheng","3":"You're back just in time. I wanted to bid you all farewell."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"Farewell?

You buy into this whole 'will of Kowloong' thing?"},{"T":"301","2":"Yusheng","3":"It's my own decision. Lady Qu left the choice to each of us."},{"T":"301","2":"Yusheng","3":"The ship is not suitable for my sick wife. Staying in the city to participate in the Tabula Akasha is more suitable for us."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"Tabula Akasha? What's that? Forget it. It doesn't matter. So, why are you going to the frontline?
