Yeah, else the Prez wouldn't send us on vacation!"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Commandant! Get a word through my good Capt., yeah? It's time to reeelaaax!"},{"T":"302","2":"You should sit down, though.","4":"Relaxing's nice."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"How could you, Commandant!"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"...Fine, I'll sit down!"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"See, Capt.!"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Besides, you're already here with us!

No one ever had the chance or leisure for sea-viewing in the past."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"So pretty... It's my first time seeing the sea like this..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Indeed... It's completely different from the grayish waters back on the Nighter..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Over 70% of Earth's surface is covered by water, so naturally, there'd be many kinds of seas."},{"T":"302","2":"Yeah.","4":"Lee..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Is that so...?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"...What?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"So!

We're flying all this way over to the Caribbean to do nothing?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"I find it quite difficult to comprehend."},{"T":"301","3":"...It does seem like a brain teaser to explain the concept of fun and leisure to Constructs. After all, their purpose is to make war, not play."},{"T":"301","3":"But before you reach a conclusion, a sudden bright flash illuminates the porthole, drawing everyone's attention."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Whoa! Wazzat?"},{"T":"301","3":"A white halo above the sea surface flirts into your eyes, followed by several building outlines."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"That's...

Some zaibatsu built this whole place, but after the virus broke out, everything's been free real estate."},{"T":"301","2":"Pilot","3":"This place is the dream for a vacation. We'll be landing nearby."},{"T":"301","2":"Pilot","3":"You can't find an airport or a runway in this stretch, so I'll hover near the pier there. You guys can hop off there."}]
