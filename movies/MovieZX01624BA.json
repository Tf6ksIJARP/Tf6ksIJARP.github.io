Go..."},{"T":"301","2":"Xun's Projection","3":"I'm worried... the commandant is also... in danger... A-after all, we only just escaped."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia's Projection","3":"How could I leave you here?!"},{"T":"301","3":"She goes to Murol and Xun, trying her best to carry one of them first. At that moment, the long-disconnected former commandant finally contacts her."},{"T":"301","2":"Former Commandant","3":"...Lucia!"},{"T":"301","3":"He gasps for air as if he has just been through an arduous battle."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia's Projection","3":"Commandant! Murol and Xun are seriously wounded. I need support!"},{"T":"301","2":"Former Commandant","3":"We can't! I know it's cruel to say this, but leave them there."},{"T":"301","2":"Former Commandant","3":"I've been ambushed! Get over here and provide backup!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia's Projection","3":"I can't abandon our comrades!"},{"T":"301","2":"Murol's Projection","3":"Don't worry about us...
