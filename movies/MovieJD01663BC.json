They stopped fighting amongst themselves and tried to fight the evil king and those who'd turned into monsters."},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"Why did they try to fight those who'd turned into monsters?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Because those people became immortal monsters. The humans were afraid that they wouldn't be able to fight the monsters if they ever got bullied by them."},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"Why didn't the humans just drink the elixir themselves?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Because they were afraid that the elixir would either kill them or turn them into monsters."},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"...So what happened next?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"The leader of the humans caught one of the monsters.
