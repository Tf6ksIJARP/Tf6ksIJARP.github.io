Are you part of my dreams?"},{"T":"302","2":"...Data on Luna, huh."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Yeah. From our current observations, the Red Tide only consumes consciousnesses going through near-death experiences within it."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Human or Construct, when they face death, their deepest emotions hidden inside their memories become bare.

What's wrong?"},{"T":"302","2":"Drowner effect?"},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Something from an earlier age when Construct tech wasn't that mature. If a commandant's Mind Beacon with a Construct isn't stable enough, or if they aren't compatible, the M.I.N.D. will try to get rid of the intruder."},{"T":"302","2":"What happens then?","4":"Is this why 'remote link' was discontinued?"},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Let's imagine the M.I.N.D. as an ocean. A Construct is like someone that's drowning, so they'll instinctively grab at anything they can."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"That's part of the reason. But mostly, it's because remote link back then can cause irreparable psychological damage to a commandant."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"But that's nothing to worry about now. The compatibility of our modern Constructs blows the earlier models out of the water. You can be rest assured that the drowner effect won't happen."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"After all, if this happens even once, we'd lose precious commandant personnel.
