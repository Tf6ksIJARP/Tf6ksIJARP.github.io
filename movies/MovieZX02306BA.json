[{"T":"301","3":"In the dark room, Vanessa is stirring her porridge in her cup with an exquisite coffee spoon. Commandant \u3010kuroname\u3011 is lying on the bed next to her, still unconscious."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"What's wrong? Surprised I'm eating porridge from a cup?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"I know it's not exactly my style, but I like to make the best of things when a situation is out of my control."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"I'm sure you've realized by now. Babylonia's cut off aid."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"What?"},{"T":"301","3":"Liv had obviously been too busy taking care of everyone to realize this fact."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Since the last rescue operation failed, if you ask them about their next operation or their change in tactics, they always give a vague response."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"They're also not providing regular contact. Whenever I contact them, they just give the same response."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Lucia also got the same response, too."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia, Liv & Lee","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"It's nothing too unusual. They've just postponed support operations to this area for the time being."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"They've done this in the past. It's just the first time I've experienced it."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia, Liv & Lee","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Guess your indifference means you've all been mentally prepared for this?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Looks like we're on our own for now."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Yeah, it's unrealistic to expect to be rescued under these circumstances. I'd do the same if I were in charge. It's the only logical solution."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Aside from that, there's some good news and bad news."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"The good news is, even though Babylonia has cut off support, they haven't blocked my access to GPS intel."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"The bad news is, based on this GPS intel, the Unidentified Twins have entered City 042."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"What are you guys gonna do?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Our location is dangerous. With our numbers, we'll suffer losses if we run into any hostile encounters."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"I want to disperse the 164 people gathered into several teams, which is more conducive to action."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"We've had some more refugees join over the past few days. We now have 172 people and a dog, but that doesn't include us and the commandant."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"We're already at 172 people?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Decentralization is definitely conducive to dealing with emergencies, but it'll take more time to retreat. We'd better get ready immediately."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"On the way, we also need to deal with three problems: high Punishing concentration, lack of food and energy, and Hetero-Creature attacks."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Protective gear can protect us against the Punishing concentration. We don't have enough for everyone, but we can move them in waves."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"The second problem is difficult to solve. All we can do is move slowly."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"As for the third problem... we'll just have to defend it with everyone."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Where can we move everyone?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"To safe zones adjacent to City 043\u2014Cities 046, 044, and 045."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"We just came from City 045. Their conservation area is already full after taking in refugees from City 044."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"And personnel from City 046 were evacuated after their CPF was damaged, so it's been vacant for some time."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"The CPF has since been repaired, but it's quite the distance from here. Not to mention... The people living there aren't exactly accepting of outsiders."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"No, that's an understatement, and it'll lead to inaccurate danger assessment. They're a group of armed Scavengers that'll attack and rob outsiders."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"City 044 is completely empty, but the CPF still hasn't been repaired. Hetero-Creatures have swarmed the perimeter, so they may converge into the Red Tide at any moment."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Looks like there isn't any ideal location."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Are you going to find a place for them to live and work in peace? Is the next step to investigate whether the soil is suitable for agriculture?"},{"T":"301","3":"She gracefully eats a spoonful of her porridge, then laughs sardonically."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Just find a refuge for them to hold out for the time being."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Wait for the twins to leave City 043, then return and repair the damaged buildings."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"The world will be used up no matter how big it is, as long as they keep treading toward the unknown."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"If \u3010kuroname\u3011 was conscious right now, I'm sure the commandant would resort to the same guerilla tactics."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"You think you know \u3010kuroname\u3011?"},{"T":"301","3":"Vanessa sets down her spoon and just laughs coldly at Lee."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Let's temporarily divide the crowd into three groups for evacuation."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Those who can move freely will wear protective gear and follow the safety route we'll plan to bypass the potential battle zone where the Red Tide may converge and proceed to City 044."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Two Constructs will act as guards. While en route, the refugees should refrain from removing their protective gear. They will return once safe living conditions are confirmed in City 044."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Understood. We'll have some of the wounded take supplies to City 045. While I searched the area, I found a warehouse with a small filtering device. The conditions are poor, but people can survive there with some simple protection."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"For the third team, we'll take the commandant, Vanessa, Bambinata, and the rest of the wounded to City 046. Regardless of how hostile they are to outsiders, they can't do much against Constructs."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"That sure was quick. I expect nothing less from the Chief."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"This may solve the problems caused by the threat of insufficient materials and the twins, but that doesn't cover everything. Don't you know?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Constructs need to protect the refugees from Hetero-Creatures while in transit."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Some of the wounded will need to be transported out."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Humans will need protective gear, but we don't have enough for each person. That means the group going to City 046 will be unprotected."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Correct. But there's one more thing... We can't avoid casualties along the way."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"I hope you have seen your fair share of hardship and cruelty, Gray Raven. Don't disrupt the team with the illusion of saving everyone."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"What do you mean?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Seems like you guys have been spending too much time trying to rescue people out there. You don't know how many people will actually be able to keep up. I'm sure Liv can enlighten you."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"We can't take the wounded all at once. They also can't move quickly in the state that they're in, and our vehicles don't have the capacity for everyone."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Are you planning to leave people behind if we run out of time?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Exactly. But only if time is of the essence. I don't want people's lives to be sacrificed in vain, but I don't want to risk the success of the mission."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"And I don't want this to be a point of contention between us."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia, Liv & Lee","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Anything that you're not happy about? Or are you still expecting \u3010kuroname\u3011 to regain consciousness and come up with some big-brained solution that won't require anyone to be sacrificed?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"If not, I'll be the active commandant here. This is the only way we can save the most lives."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"If worst comes to worst, who do you think is most likely to encounter danger? Me and Bambinata? Those refugees who still have the strength to run? Or that comatose commandant of yours?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Forget it. After all, a puppet led by \u3010kuroname\u3011 will just shout, 'I'll protect everyone,' then rush in and die."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"No point in asking you..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...Let's plan our next step."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"I still think it's necessary to evacuate the critically injured to City 045 and 046 first."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"You're right. If we have time, they should go first. If the healthy refugees leave first, they may be left here for good."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Looks like you've become well acquainted with the inferiority of humans."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"This doesn't make them inferior. Everyone just wants to live, so we need to plan."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Whatever you say..."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"The twins haven't made it to City 043 yet, but..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"I've detected a large horde of Hetero-Creatures from the north, 130 klicks!"},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"...?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"They're headed right for us. ETA 8 hours."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"How many?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Roughly over a hundred. Can we hold them off?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"No, Liv. If they've already grouped up, there are more than a hundred."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"I saw something similar in City 044. There's bound to be more beyond your detection range."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"There may be ten or even a hundred times more than that. If they find out where we're hiding, we won't be able to defend against such a large horde."},{"T":"301","3":"Vanessa sneers to herself and eats the porridge in her cup, which had gone cold."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Looks like we won't hold out until morning, so we should evacuate immediately."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Understood. But I hope we proceed according to the plan. Evacuate the wounded first, then the other Construct Soldiers will escort those who can walk in an orderly manner, so that they can receive help from other stranded elite teams as soon as possible."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Some of the wounded can leave on the transport vehicles. After all, your commandant only needs one seat."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"But I advise you to give up on the latter. Strike Hawk and Cerberus are in the same situation as us."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"There'll be more survivors in a base with doctors, but the team won't be able to transfer the influx of wounded."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"If none of the wounded had survived, this wouldn't be an issue."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Please don't say something like that...!"},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"As I said, there are going to be sacrifices along the way. You don't expect the Hetero-Creatures to wait for you to take your time evacuating everyone, do you?"},{"T":"301","3":"Unwilling to accept such a dire consequence, they have no choice but to accept the reality that they cannot change the status quo."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"How many vehicles are left?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Including the vehicles we recovered over the past few days from the destroyed conservation areas, we have three left."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Hurry up and get your commandant into protective gear."},{"T":"301","3":"Leaving the room where Vanessa and the commandant are located to begin preparations, they are met with an unexpected scene outside."},{"T":"301","3":"People have already packed their scarce bags of luggage. As Gray Raven exits the room, the refugees look at them coldly."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"...Where's everyone going?"},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"We're going to the Forsaken's base."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"There's no way you can make it there on foot."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"So I'm going to 'borrow' your rescue vehicles."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"...Why are you leaving all of a sudden?"},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"I know you won't tell us the truth. Seeing you all sneak around like that, I took advantage of the noise outside to eavesdrop on your conversation."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"What did you hear?"},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"Babylonia has stopped sending aid. I heard that Construct say it."},{"T":"301","3":"He points at Lee's terminal as if stating the obvious."},{"T":"301","2":"Construct Soldier","3":"We were just going over possible scenarios with the others... I didn't think anyone had the nerve to eavesdrop on us."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"Doesn't matter. I knew it was only a matter of time."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"There've been numerous incidents in the neighboring conservation areas. And since Babylonia has hung us out to dry and those damn twins are wandering around City 041 again, we don't want to stay here and await death."},{"T":"301","2":"Quina","3":"The three vehicles are up and running and we've got the protective gear, Boss. Let's go."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Please don't take the vehicles! We need them to evacuate the critically wounded!"},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee 5","3":"What are we supposed to do then? Not like we can make it there on foot."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee 6","3":"Won't you be better off with the wounded when we're gone? You'll have more room, and it'll be quieter."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"(Seems like they don't know about the Hetero-Creatures and the twins headed right for us...)"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Three vehicles can't hold 172 people. How are you going to deal with Corrupted and Hetero-Creatures if you get attacked? Outnumber them?"},{"T":"301","3":"The crowd falls silent for a moment before whispering amongst each other."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"That's why we need to leave before they swarm us."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"Scavengers like us have our own ways of operating. Leave the rest to us."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Please, don't!"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Everything we've done is to ensure as many people can survive as possible!"},{"T":"301","3":"Liv hesitates for a few seconds, but decides that it's best to inform everyone of the current situation to avert confusion."},{"T":"301","3":"The refugees had always believed they had the right to know what was happening. A time like this requires everyone to work together to solve the problem."},{"T":"301","3":"What would happen if they made a decision without knowing the danger? Liv can't even bear the thought of it."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Please, listen. I just detected a horde of Hetero-Creatures approaching from the north. They'll be here in eight hours. Also, the twins already left City 041 and have made it to City 042. We need to evacuate with the wounded immediately."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"If you take the vehicles, we won't be able to evacuate the wounded on foot! If the Hetero-Creatures break through our defenses, they'll enter the basement and kill the wounded!"},{"T":"301","3":"Hearing this, the whole basement becomes speechless."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"The middle-aged leader looks around the crowd in silence. He contemplates for a few seconds, then turns to face Liv."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"We'll take your word for it considering you've taken care of us and the wounded all this time."},{"T":"301","3":"Saying this, he pauses for several more seconds. After hearing no objection, he continues to speak."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"Since you're willing to be so honest, I'll make concessions to the Constructs and wounded."},{"T":"301","3":"The crowd erupts in outcry, led by the shrill voices of several refugees."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee 3","3":"Leave the wounded here! Not like they'll survive much longer if we take them anyway!"},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee 8","3":"I don't wanna die here!!"},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee 8","3":"There's no way I can walk all the way there!"},{"T":"301","3":"The refugee leader remains silent among the crowd's protest until several others strong-arm their way in front of him."},{"T":"301","2":"Refuge 9","3":"Boss...!"},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"What's wrong? You're not wounded. You've just been hungry for a few days, and now you can't walk?"},{"T":"301","2":"Refuge 9","3":"No way! Besides, she said those monsters will be here in eight hours. How can we run past those monsters?! And if they don't come, what about those wandering outside?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"We're armed and there's a lot of us. We can handle ourselves as long as there aren't too many."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"He's right, Doctor. We wanted to take the vehicles because our people are too exhausted to walk."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"Given the emergency, we should give priority to the wounded that can't walk, but we weren't just going to drive away carelessly."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"If someone falls along the way, they'll slow the rest of us down. We'll be sitting ducks if we get attacked."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"I understand. Are you at least willing to leave any vehicles?"},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"How about this..."},{"T":"301","3":"He raises his voice over the crowd's discussion."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"We'll take the smallest vehicle to carry everyone's luggage and for people to rest when needed. The other two are rescue vehicles, so they're more suitable for transporting the wounded."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"That way, we can guarantee our safety to a certain extent while also not disregarding the lives of others."},{"T":"301","3":"The crowd gradually falls silent, but concerns still remain."},{"T":"301","2":"Refuge 10","3":"But those Hetero-Creatures will be here in 8 hours! There's no way we can outrun them on foot!"},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"Even if we take all three vehicles, there isn't enough space for everyone. You think you'll be one of the lucky ones who get a ride?"},{"T":"301","2":"Refuge 10","3":"Then what should we do, Boss?"},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"Calm down. We need to come up with a plan."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"Where were you planning on taking us and the wounded?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Given the current situation, it will be best for the healthy refugees to go to City 044."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"There are still issues with the CPF and the Punishing concentration is high, but there won't be any issues along the planned route if everyone wears protective gear."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Once City 043 is safe, you can come back."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"Seems reasonable. It's the nearest city with a direct road and minimal Corrupted wandering around there."},{"T":"301","3":"He deliberately raises his voice as if speaking to the crowd behind him."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"But if everyone going wears protective gear, there won't be enough for the wounded."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"There's also a warehouse at City 045 with a small filtration device. I'm not sure it's strong enough to guarantee safety, but anyone with normal-level protective gear should do just fine there."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Correct. That's where we'll take some of the wounded."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"We'll take the rest of the wounded to the conservation area in City 046. They should still have enough room to take us in."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"City 046... Those crazy bastards are just as dangerous as Corrupted. But you're right, there's not much they can do against Constructs."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Then it's settled."},{"T":"301","3":"She slowly walks out of the room. It is as if she had been listening the whole time. Together with her is Bambinata, who now resembles an old doll."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"We should hurry."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"Wait, we're not finished here."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"Going there on foot is going to take a while. As close as City 044 is, we might not even be able to cross City 043's borders in 8 hours."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"I accept that the doctor genuinely wants us to leave the vehicles here to save the wounded, but I'm not so sure about you..."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"You're standing in as the temporary commandant here, right? I don't know what their commandant is normally like, but I have an idea based on the others in Gray Raven. But you..."},{"T":"301","3":"He forces a sneer."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"People like you put human lives on one side of the scale and your own personal interests on the other. We've only been stuck here together for a month, but I know your type."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"If you evacuate with the wounded, who's to say you won't abandon them and guarantee your own safety?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Hmph... I'm just trying to save the most lives."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Given our current situation, we don't have enough time and materials to save everyone. Sacrifices will have to be made."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"What about that wounded deadweight?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Human lives aren't equal. If you had to choose between a cracked jewel or some pebble in a muddy ditch, which would you choose?"},{"T":"301","2":"Refuge 10","3":"As expected from one of Babylonia's 'officers'... You bastards are just putting a price on our heads just like what they did during the Great Evacuation."},{"T":"301","3":"Sensing a fight about to break out between both sides, Liv wants to rush forward and say something, but she's stopped by Lee before she can do anything."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"Quiet down, Lawson. This 'Great Evacuation' is in our hands now."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"The three cars outside are ours. If you want the two rescue vehicles, you have to listen to us. Try and take them by violence, one shot from my gun here and they'll be gone. Are you sure you want that?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Well, then. What is it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"Let our people and the wounded retreat first, and you and other Constructs stay here to stop the incoming attack."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"In any case, two cars aren't enough for everyone, They'll take the wounded and then come back for us. We won't have made it far at this point."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"You want them to come back?"},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"That's right. I'm sure the doctor and her team will be able to escort the wounded and return safely."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"Once everyone has retreated safely, you and that unconscious commandant of yours can leave."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"I can have the other Constructs escort you and leave together."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"I don't trust you. You'll just call them off whenever you get the chance. Slow as we are with all the wounded, we'll be targeted even before we make it out of City 043."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"As opposed to me ordering them to pick me up first when you hand over the vehicles?"},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"We'll have our eyes on you. You'll leave only when all the wounded have been evacuated first."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"...Hmph. Even if Gray Raven chooses to listen to you, I can leave with my puppet any time I want."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"But that'd be a death sentence going out there on foot just the two of you."},{"T":"301","2":"Refugee Leader","3":"You don't wanna give up that 'cracked jewel' of yours, do you?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Fine. I'll take up the rear. Quit wasting time and get out of here."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Vanessa..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Are you sure about that?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Get back here ASAP. Otherwise, it's going to be our funerals."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"One more thing. You... What's your name?"},{"T":"301","3":"She points to the Construct beside her and beckons."},{"T":"301","2":"Female Construct","3":"My name's Sandra, Commandant Vanessa."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Sandra, go be one of their drivers. I'm sure there are going to be plenty of surprises along the way given how many Corrupted and Hetero-Creatures are coming this way."},{"T":"301","2":"Sandra","3":"Understood."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...Let's get going, Liv."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"I'll leave the evacuation plan up to you. You are more clear on the situation with the wounded."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"You got it."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"We'll evacuate the critically wounded and some of the less severely wounded first. It's going to be difficult to take that many people all at once given how big the stretchers are."},{"T":"301","3":"Liv opens her medical log and quickly examines the list of wounded. The log hasn't been updated recently, but the current situation is clearly printed in Liv's mind."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"The eight critically wounded, Nagayuki, Kanata, and Lindsey need to stay behind for the time being."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"The first two need Vanessa to maintain stable M.I.N.D.s, while Lindsey's wounds can't withstand the crowded and bumpy vehicles, so she needs to be carried away separately on a stretcher with stabilizers once all the other Construct Soldiers have gathered."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"The one the commandant used?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Well, the commandant doesn't need it now."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"As for Mr. Cali, I don't know if he'll agree to go."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"The old man who wasn't eating after being diagnosed with cancer? Let me ask him."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Even if he doesn't agree to go, we still need space for four more people. These people alone will take up two cars. At most, they can take the little girl with them."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"They can make do in the crowded vehicle if we get there fast enough."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Let's make some supports between stretchers so we can put them close together without being cramped."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Good idea, but there's still only enough room for four stretchers. We can only fit a few more sitting down."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"I'll leave it to you then, Lee."},{"T":"301","3":"He nods and makes his way to the warehouse."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"As for the second vehicle..."},{"T":"301","3":"She thumbs through the records on her terminal and makes a new list."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"They don't need stretchers, but even then, they need to be separated due to their wounds."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Even if some people lie under the seats or sit on the legs of those who aren't injured, we can't squeeze them in."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Not to mention, our vehicles haven't been modified. So they can't be overloaded, right?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Exactly."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"How many more people do we need to take?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"We still have 47 wounded... No... Counting the new arrivals over the past few days... That makes 62 people, but the second car can only carry 17. With 4 people in the first car, that means we can only take 21 people in a single trip."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"That's fine. There's still some hope if we can make another trip."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"But there are still several other critically injured and our commandant that need to go on the next trip."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"That means there's no time for hesitation. We'll need to make a third trip."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Yeah... Let's call everyone."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Okay."},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia walks to the basement. After a short time, some wounded refugees limp out following her."},{"T":"301","2":"Fantine","3":"Liv..."},{"T":"301","3":"Since Fantine's name is on the first list, she steps out of the crowd and greets Liv with a smile."},{"T":"301","2":"Fantine","3":"Thank you, Liv, but I want to give up my spot."},{"T":"301","3":"She looks at the crowd and rubs her belly."},{"T":"301","2":"Fantine","3":"It's too crowded for me. And, I haven't decided if I want to bring my child into this cruel world... I need some time to think."},{"T":"301","2":"Fantine","3":"After you leave, the wounded here also need to be looked after. My medical knowledge obviously doesn't compare to yours, but I can still help."},{"T":"301","2":"Fantine","3":"Can you take the child I brought with me instead? The wound on his back is still serious, and he needs some room."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"...Okay."},{"T":"301","2":"Fantine","3":"Oh, and Shrek wants to speak with you."},{"T":"301","2":"Shrek","3":"(Clears throat)"},{"T":"301","3":"He greets Liv, pretending to be relaxed."},{"T":"301","2":"Shrek","3":"Let me go with you. I'll sit on the roof so I don't take up any space. Besides, if any of the wounded sit up there, they'll most likely fall down. Right?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Are you sure? It's dangerous up there."},{"T":"301","2":"Shrek","3":"Don't worry. I'll hold on tight."},{"T":"301","2":"Shrek","3":"You said you want to evacuate to a warehouse in City 045, but is there a doctor there to take care of them? Or are you going to stay there with them?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"No. That's what I've been worried about."},{"T":"301","2":"Shrek","3":"So, someone should be there to look after them, right? I'm no doctor, but I've learned a thing or two about first aid recently."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Recently...?"},{"T":"301","2":"Shrek","3":"Got that right. A friend of mine made me realize how important it is."},{"T":"301","2":"Shrek","3":"If you don't trust me, I can have the Forsaken send a doctor over."},{"T":"301","2":"Shrek","3":"That way, I can continue on my way and deliver the serum. They can't possibly refuse... Right?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"...Okay. Thank you."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Good idea. We should also try to get support from Watanabe."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"If only the commandant was still conscious..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"We could use the commandant to pull some strings?"},{"T":"301","3":"Having finished assembling the stretchers, Lee appears behind the three of them with a frowning face."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"I know what you're worried about, but Babylonia cut off communication. Who knows, maybe we'll end up joining the Forsaken..."},{"T":"301","3":"She looks up at the dim sky, suddenly getting lost in a memory."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"I understand why they made this decision, and I don't think it was out of greed or malice, but we're on our own now."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"I'm used to that by now."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Shrek","3":"You guys talk things over. Want me to go get the wounded?"},{"T":"301","3":"Feeling the gravity of their words, he waves and quickly runs back to the basement."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Oh, Liv. Cali said he's not going with the others."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"...Really? I understand."},{"T":"301","3":"Over ten minutes later, thanks to everyone's efforts, the first group is already in position."},{"T":"301","3":"People are crowded together, but not so cramped that the wounded are crushed."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Everything's ready. Let's go."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"I'll deal with the Hetero-Creatures along the way. Liv, take care of the wounded. Lee and Sandra, the other Construct, take care of the driving."},{"T":"301","3":"Lee nods and furrows his eyebrows anxiously."},{"T":"301","3":"He starts the engine, causing the siren on the rescue vehicle and an alarm from the dashboard speakers to blare."},{"T":"301","3":"ALERT: Vehicle overloaded. Please drive safely and in accordance with the law."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"The anxiety in Lee's inner brow increases noticeably. He quickly unscrews the cover of the speaker and adeptly cuts the alarm's circuit, silencing the noise."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Let's get going."}]
