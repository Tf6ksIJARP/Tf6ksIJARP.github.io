[{"T":"302","2":"Tch..."},{"T":"301","3":"You have lost track of time, but the pain still lingers on your forehead. You feel the soft mattress on your back. The pendant lamp above you sways from the breeze."},{"T":"302","2":"It is a familiar ceiling."},{"T":"301","3":"You seem to have returned to the same bedroom. The interior looks no different, and you are wearing an identical, casual outfit."},{"T":"301","3":"But unlike last time, it is a sunny day outside. The alarm clock reads 08:00."},{"T":"301","3":"And Nanami is still not in the room."},{"T":"301","3":"'Knock-knock.'"},{"T":"301","3":"You hear a light knocking sound on the door. After smoothing out the wrinkles on your clothes, you walk to the door and put your hand on the handle\u2014"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Comm... Senior \u3010kuroname\u3011, are you awake?"},{"T":"301","3":"The voice sends a chill up your spine. All your muscles immediately contract, stopping your hand from turning the handle."},{"T":"301","3":"You finally understand what Nanami meant by 'playing your role.'"},{"T":"302","2":"(So this is what we're doing now.)"},{"T":"301","3":"You calm yourself and open the door. The girl before you is wearing a dress and standing calmly."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Huh, you are already awake. I was going to ambush you."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"What a pity..."},{"T":"302","2":"..."},{"T":"302","2":"Put the chainsaw down first. Show some decency.","4":"When you say ambush, do you mean dismantling me with that?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Okay."},{"T":"301","3":"The chainsaw is almost half of Nanami's height, but she tosses it away with ease. It hits the floor and makes a dull noise."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Now I can't see Comm\u2014eh... Senior \u3010kuroname\u3011's sleeping face."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"No, I only wanted to use the chainsaw to open the door."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"By ambush... I mean to look at Comm... um, Senior \u3010kuroname\u3011's sleeping face."},{"T":"302","2":"I never sleep in."},{"T":"301","3":"You are a soldier after all. You follow strict daily routines."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"I see."},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami takes more notes on the holo-screen."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Let's go to school, Comm... um, Senior \u3010kuroname\u3011."},{"T":"301","3":"Before that, there is still a question that bothers you\u2014"},{"T":"302","2":"Why are you playing a freshman this time?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Because Nanami wants to experience it!"},{"T":"301","3":"It is indeed a very Nanami-like answer. Still\u2014"},{"T":"302","2":"You can't even get used to it yourself."},{"T":"302","2":"I think you should give up that setting."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"But this is what I planned..."},{"T":"302","2":"I think you should follow your heart."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Hmm..."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Commandant, you're right. Nanami prefers this more."},{"T":"301","3":"Seeing Nanami no longer insists on calling you 'Senior,' you feel relieved. At least you don't have to call her 'Freshman Nanami'."},{"T":"302","2":"Let's go then."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Huh? Where are we going?"},{"T":"301","3":"Were you not going to school?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Oh, that's already over."},{"T":"301","3":"Over?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Nanami only wanted to be your junior, Commandant. After the morning call, that experience is over."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Nanami didn't get to break into your bedroom or use the chainsaw as planned, but that was the end of the story."},{"T":"301","3":"Is 'break into' literal?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"After arriving at school, we will be separated based on grades. Then your 'classmates' will have a chance to hit on you."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"I won't let that happen!"},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami crosses her arms, making a giant 'X' sign."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Besides, school is so boring. I'm not going there."},{"T":"301","3":"Don't look down on school!"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Let's move on to the next experience, Commandant!"},{"T":"302","2":"How many are there?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"This\u2014many\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami taps her screen open, and you see a long, almost infinite string of numbers."},{"T":"302","2":"That's too many!","4":"Will I ever live to finish them?"},{"T":"301","3":"Is the number still increasing down there?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Don't worry! I've got a plan!"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"And you don't have to worry about time. Time passes much faster here than in real life."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Enough with this. Let's go!"},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami grabs your hand, and your vision blurs for a second before the scenery in front of you transforms from a bedroom to an amusement park. Not to mention..."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Does it feel familiar, Commandant?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"That's right! This is the abandoned park we visited before\u2014"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Except Nanami has fixed everything here!"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Now, we can play through everything for once!"},{"T":"301","3":"The park before you no longer looks deserted and neglected, just as Nanami said. All the facilities have been repaired and renovated."},{"T":"301","3":"The Ferris wheel is spinning, the rollercoaster soaring past you. A clown robot is waving at you in front of the door to the haunted house."},{"T":"301","3":"The metal, plastic, and fabrics have all been coated with new colors by Nanami, who has reconstructed the magical kingdom before your very eyes."},{"T":"301","3":"Except\u2014"},{"T":"302","2":"(My spider sense is tingling...)"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Commandant, let's ride the carousel!"},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami leads you to the carousel. You pick a random horse and hop on."},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami, meanwhile, jumps on behind you, wrapping her arms around your waist."},{"T":"302","2":"N-Nanami?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"It's about to start, Commandant. Remember to hold on tight!"},{"T":"301","3":"Right as she says that, the horses start moving."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Your heart is racing as well, Commandant."},{"T":"301","3":"Holding you close, Nanami seems to be listening to your heartbeat. When she speaks, her breath is carried through your clothes, caressing your back."},{"T":"301","3":"But you do not have time to pay attention to that\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"It is not an exaggeration to say that your heart has never beaten as fast as it does right now your entire life."},{"T":"301","3":"After all\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"The horse you are riding is currently traversing through the air at 500 kilometers per hour. This is a bona fide panoramic flight experience."},{"T":"302","2":"(So, 'fixed' means it can now fly!)"},{"T":"301","3":"The turbulence dissuades you from talking. The freezing wind hits your face like needles piercing through your skin, threatening to tear your face off your skull. You can only hold on tight in case you are thrown off."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Hahaha! You also find this fun, don't you, Commandant?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Humans' heart rates rise when they're excited. Given how fast your heart is beating, you must find this super fun!"},{"T":"302","2":"Wabibabobabiaulawoye..."},{"T":"301","3":"Your refutation scrambles in the wind, turning into gibberish."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"In that case, let Nanami make this even more fun!"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Choo-choo! Backup generator\u2014engaged!"},{"T":"302","2":"!"},{"T":"301","3":"You are not sure how it is designed, but the horse eventually returns to its original position steadily and stops. You try your hardest not to fall when you get off it, your legs trembling and weak."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"How are you feeling, Commandant?"},{"T":"302","2":"It was too exciting..."},{"T":"302","2":"But it was very stress-relieving as well."},{"T":"301","3":"Dopamine took over your brain after the initial terror passed, and your fatigue from working the past few days has all but vanished."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"We have to do the rollercoaster next. Then the haunted house, the Ferris wheel, the bumper cars..."},{"T":"301","3":"Your face grows paler with every new attraction Nanami names. You do not dare to imagine in what ways Nanami has 'fixed' them."},{"T":"301","3":"But seeing her enthusiasm as she counts them with her fingers, you do not have the heart to reject her."},{"T":"302","2":"At least let me take a break first."}]
