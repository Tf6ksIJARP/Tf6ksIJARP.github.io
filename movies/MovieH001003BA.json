Just passing by.","4":"\u3010kuroname\u3011."},{"T":"301","3":"The 'princess of a neighboring country' who calls itself Anna ignores your response due to its simplistic AI.

If you are curious about this, someone will explain it to you once the story is over."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"What are you trying to do?"},{"T":"301","3":"The Witch of the Sea takes out two dice, tossing them in the sea, then she watches them slowly fall into her palm."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"Would you believe me if I were to say all of this was to restore this island's former glory?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"By forcing us at gunpoint?"},{"T":"301","3":"The Witch of the Sea waves her hand in silence. The Mini Bot clinging onto her suddenly pulls out a device and attaches it to her back, integrating it with her artificial skin."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"What are you doing?"},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"Unlike the witch in the story, I can't take away your voice. However, I can do this to keep you quiet."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"Once you leave the sea, the device will detonate if you say a single word. Of course, the same will happen if you try to remove it."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"Only I can restore your voice."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"You can't possibly think this island's former glory can only be restored by force, do you?"},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"Obviously. No one will ever return to this island. So, why not go out with a bang?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...Do you get some sort of sick enjoyment out of this?"},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"Do you not?"},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"You continue to fight and bleed for the unobtainable goal of saving this Earth. But doesn't that make you happy?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Because I have gained a lot along the way."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"...Gain."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"Much like how the mermaid princess gained the ability to walk on land. Each step brings great pain."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"You..."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"Hehe... Your expression now seems to be questioning why I know this."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"But in fact... I don't even know your real name. The reason why I say this is because, as a Construct, I've encountered similar things."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"Constructs are like mermaids\u2014perfect creations."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"It retains the most beautiful features of humanity while removing its shortcomings, such as thirst, hunger, sleep, and to a large extent\u2014mortality."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"But this kind of perfection is indeed a defect for most humans. Much like that beautiful tail of a mermaid."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"Humanity will always regard Constructs as abominations. They fear our strength, our perfection. They worry that they will be replaced and lose everything that they have."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"Even those who can accept this, they will still harbor resentment within their heart\u2014for their lifespans are far too unequal. Whether it be them or us, one side will be left behind in this world."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"I had hosted many Constructs before you arrived."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"However, back then... This island and I were yet as we are now."},{"T":"301","3":"She somberly shares her memory to Lucia, who is surrounded by a crowd of Mini Bots and has no other choice but to listen."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"This island used to be a popular tourist resort."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"There used to be two other administrators like me\u2014Anna and Johanne.

I really enjoyed the looks of joy, anger, sorrow and happiness on their faces."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"Later, with the popularity of AR, the price also became much cheaper, so fewer people played tabletop games. I began to play as an NPC and accompany guests on adventures throughout the island."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"This also made me really happy."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"I saw some guests really immerse themselves in the story and in their roles.

I still long for this island to recover its former glory."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"A new calling?"},{"T":"301","3":"Witch of the Sea ignores Lucia's question and continues musing to herself."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"I'm glad to finally have someone to talk to. This island has not had guests in quite some time. But you seem to be more concerned about that human and finding a way out of here."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Obviously."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"Is it because of... your feelings?"},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia pauses in silence."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"More than just feelings."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"What do you want from that human?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"I didn't choose to stay with Gray Raven because I want something from the commandant."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"I stayed because I wanted to fulfill the commandant's vision of the future."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"You really are loyal. As a tool to achieve someone else's goals, you must be highly praised, right?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...Is that all that you can comprehend?"},{"T":"301","3":"The Witch of the Sea remains quiet. Instead, she smiles and nods, then motions for Lucia to continue."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Just like you, I've lost a lot."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Family, friends, comrades... Even my memories have been twisted and distorted for one reason or another."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"But I didn't become a Construct because I had no other choice."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Instead, I didn't want to see other people being forced to experience the same pain, so I chose to fight."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"The other Gray Ravens under the commandant's leadership are the same."},{"T":"301","3":"She looks off into the distant sea, slightly smiling ever so gently."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"We have the same purpose and will surely move toward the same future."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"This should have been a road full of sacrifice and death, but the commandant hasn't sacrificed anyone in order to achieve victory."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Saving Earth may seem like a pipe dream, but with the commandant here, such an idealistic dream seems less painful and within reach."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Since I don't want anyone else to share the same pain, of course, I will spare no effort in protecting my teammates and our leader so that they can make this happen."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"You mean, you are not a tool to achieve someone's goals, but rather, you work together to realize the same goals?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Of course. The major premise for pursuing your dreams, is to realize that we all have our own goals and can make our own choices."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"A tool is someone who has lost sight of their goal and cannot make their own choices. I never have been nor will I ever be used as a tool by the commandant!"},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"Your ideals are all well and good, but you haven't addressed my initial question about feelings."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Because feelings have long since gone without saying to me."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Some thoughts, even if they go unmentioned, will slowly grow in your heart after being with someone every day and working together with them."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"No matter how hard the battle was, or how confused my fractured memory made me, the commandant always kept me grounded."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"That's what has allowed me to continue on my path so resolutely."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"For me, whether I become the sheath that guards the blade, or the blade that opens up the way and continues onward with the sheath, working toward the same goal is the source of my feelings. I don't need to make such a big deal about it."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"Really...?"},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"Blade and sheath..."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"Sounds like the fated encounter between two fairy tale protagonists and live happily ever after."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"If only Master were like this. I-I would've enjoyed working toward the same future with h-him."},{"T":"301","3":"There is a slight tremor in her usually slow and calm tone."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"But when I insisted on my idea, he still chose to destroy everyone and personally... dismantled the other two administrators bit by bit."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"Had I not grabbed their memory shells in time, they would've been gone by now."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Bit by bit?"},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia remembers the modified story, thinking about what the prince said before pulling out his sword."},{"T":"301","3":"\u2014'No matter. I had yet to retire to bed anyway.'"},{"T":"301","3":"Just like the unresolved story hidden within this remark, Lucia notices that the 'master' of this island seems to have something left untold."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"If he wanted to destroy the two administrators, wouldn't there be an easier way to do it instead of disassembling them?"},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"I beg your pardon?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Why else would he go through the trouble? He wanted to keep you all from the very beginning."},{"T":"301","3":"Hearing this, the Witch of the Sea stands there speechless."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"The terminal... Were you the one who changed the ending of the 'Legend of the Mermaid'?"},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"She refrains from responding as if she is still ruminating on the possibility Lucia mentioned just prior."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"No, that's impossible..."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"That day... The last memory he left me was of him reprimanding me. I wasn't even a tool to him, let alone something worthy of his feelings. Why would he want to keep us?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"What if he was trying to convince someone else?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Only if they believed him, could you live here in peace."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"...If? Regardless, I have no way of proving it anymore."},{"T":"301","3":"She shakes her head solemnly."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"It's too late now. It's been far too long. My hands have been stained with too much blood, not only those people, but also..."},{"T":"301","3":"The Witch of the Sea falls silent."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"It doesn't matter. Even so, I will achieve his goal and make this island prosperous again."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"In this regard, I must thank you two."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"Although this place is a shadow of its former self and you are reluctant to say the least... you still play with everyone for a while."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"Even if it's fleeting, it's more important to create precious memory data than anything else."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...Anything else you wish to tell me?"},{"T":"301","3":"The Witch of the Sea rubs the dice in her hand and chooses to ignore the question."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"According to the script, your 'sisters' are supposed to come here and make an exchange for the sword to kill the 'prince.' But since there are just the two of you, I'll just give you the sword."},{"T":"301","3":"She places the sharp sword in Lucia's hand."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"Now, I will send you back to land. If you kill the 'prince,' I will restore your freedom and voice."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"But if the 'prince' is still alive on the last day, you will be turned into foam to float on the sea."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"Let me witness the moment in which the trust in your relationship you take such pride in is shattered."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"The commandant will never doubt me, and I will never do anything to betray this trust."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"Then you will turn into seafoam... and stay here forever."}]
