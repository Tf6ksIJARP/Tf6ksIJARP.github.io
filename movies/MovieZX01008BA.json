[{"T":"301","2":"Aston","3":"We meet again, commandant from Babylonia. Thanks to your reckless behavior, this carriage is no longer safe."},{"T":"302","2":"The carriages near the Hetero-Core were not safe from the start.","4":"We won't leave anyone behind."},{"T":"301","2":"Aston","3":"That's not true. At least those filthy Corrupted never invaded our carriage."},{"T":"301","2":"Ashlar","3":"Is this how Babylonia works? Always spieling lies like that? Revolting."},{"T":"301","2":"Crying Commoner Child","3":"Wahhhhh! Momma! Momma! Wahhh! Where are you..."},{"T":"301","2":"Angry Aristocrat Woman","3":"Shoo! Stop pulling on my dress with your filthy hands! Whose child is this?! Take it away!"},{"T":"301","2":"Sobbing Commoner Woman","3":"My love... I'm sorry... Ahh... Why did I escape alone..."},{"T":"301","2":"Agitated Aristocrat Man","3":"I've had enough of these pesky scums! Why are we not moving forward?! I can't stand being in the same carriage as these filthy mutts for one more second!"},{"T":"301","2":"Ashlar","3":"Tsk, it's too crowded here... Reminds me of why I hate crowds..."},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"Which is why I suggested going to Babylonia."},{"T":"301","2":"Ashlar","3":"You suggested...

Damn you for betraying us aristocrats!"},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"I have no intention to betray you. And as Aston said, going to Babylonia can satisfy your aristocratic lifestyle!"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"But even Babylonia can't accept this number of people in... This deal..."},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"I never said all, just move in the 'selected few.' You should have room for that many, right?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"You mean, only the aristocrats..."},{"T":"301","2":"Ashlar","3":"Hmph... Looks like you still know the rules."},{"T":"301","2":"Commoner","3":"What... What are you talking about..."},{"T":"301","2":"Commoner","3":"So we're gonna be abandoned either way?! Dammit!"},{"T":"301","3":"The commoners cowering in the corner by the door instantly exploded with rage."},{"T":"301","3":"A wail of sorrow pierces through the rioting crowd, and the source of the wail, a woman in tattered clothing, walks out of the crowd\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"\u2014And as if possessed by something unseen, she rushes for the door, tears it open, and scrambles toward the carriages in the back."},{"T":"301","2":"Panicking Commoner","3":"It's full of Corrupted in the back! Someone stop her..."},{"T":"301","2":"Anxious Aristocrat","3":"Are you out of your mind?! C-close the door!!"},{"T":"301","2":"Resentful Commoner","3":"Isn't she the one who got separated from her husband..."},{"T":"301","3":"The crowd hurries to close the door."},{"T":"302","2":"No, we have to save her!","4":"We have to stop her."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"O-on it!"},{"T":"301","2":"Angry Aristocrat","3":"Over our dead bodies!

You lot are all talk and no work! Always ordering us around! Get outta here if you ain't helping us to improve our livelihoods!"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Everyone, p-please calm down..."},{"T":"301","2":"Angry Aristocrat","3":"You filthy scums!

Do you understand the meaning of this?"},{"T":"302","2":"The peasants will be in control of this train.","4":"One side of the conflict will leave this train."},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"That's right. This train and the wealth that the aristocrats can't bring with them will all belong to the commoners, which should be enough for commoners to survive and thrive."},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"Correct. Both parties will be satisfied then..."},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"But that can only happen under the premise that Babylonia accepts our deal."},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"If you agree, we can form an alliance and immediately destroy that black thing."},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"But if you decline, then this train, and that horrible thing on it, will be handed over to the Ascendants as per the aristocrats' request."},{"T":"302","2":"That's a gamble, not a deal.","4":"...Is that your choice?"},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"It was a gamble from the start."},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"As you can see, the aristocrats have enough power to decide the fate of Akdilek...
