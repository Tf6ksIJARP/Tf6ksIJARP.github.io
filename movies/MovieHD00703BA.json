[{"T":"301","3":"You follow Watanabe's lead to an emptier spot of the camp."},{"T":"301","3":"The children you saw running before are now gathered there, keeping busy among themselves."},{"T":"301","3":"Watanabe slows down his pace, and you are confused about what he is intending."},{"T":"301","2":"Xiuyong","3":"Hey, what do you guys think about these..."},{"T":"301","2":"Ann","3":"That's about the right amount... And then it's up to how fast we can act. Or else we'll get discovered."},{"T":"301","2":"Deckard","3":"Is it because of the 'supplier'? I heard from my uncle about some product testing... That's why Uncle Watanabe and the others are heading out."},{"T":"301","2":"Ann","3":"...But if you think about it, the supplier also has it pretty rough, having to work at a time like this."},{"T":"301","2":"Xiuyong","3":"Wait, it should go like this... like this! Twist this, and then... Argh!"},{"T":"301","2":"Ann","3":"You're right, but don't fold it with so much force! Gently!"},{"T":"301","2":"Deckard","3":"How about it we hang it right outside the entrance? They can see it once they come back..."},{"T":"301","2":"Ann","3":"And this one too! We can glue this by the gate!"},{"T":"302","2":"What are you doing?","4":"(Approach quietly with Watanabe)"},{"T":"301","3":"All the children turn around at the same time, the excitement on their faces barely hidden."},{"T":"301","3":"The little girl is the first one to react. She steadies herself and watches you approach nervously."},{"T":"301","3":"Maybe it is the sound of your footsteps or your wavering shadow that has warned them, but the children immediately notice your presence. They are surprisingly alert."},{"T":"301","3":"They only relax until they realize that it is Watanabe who is heading toward them."},{"T":"301","2":"Deckard","3":"Uncle Watanabe! Oh, and the supplier!"},{"T":"301","2":"Xiuyong","3":"Aren't you going on a mission, Uncle Watanabe?"},{"T":"301","3":"Xiuyong and Deckard deliberately step forward, blocking Ann and the things she is holding in her arms from your view."},{"T":"301","3":"Watanabe acts like he has not noticed what they did, and he crouches to their height with a solemn and respectful expression."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"I am, but that is going to take a while to prepare, so I am here to check and see how your mission's going."},{"T":"301","2":"Deckard","3":"...Even so, you should have said something. It's pretty rude to just sneak up on us!"},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"Your enemies won't greet you before they sneak up on you. I'll let you off this time since it's your first mistake, but not a second time, got it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Xiuyong & Deckard","3":"Got it!"},{"T":"301","2":"Ann","3":"You silly! You should have said, 'Yes, Sir!'"},{"T":"301","3":"The girl hiding behind them suddenly speaks, standing on her toes to look at Watanabe between the two boys."},{"T":"301","3":"The boys notice Watanabe's gaze shifting, and they move up to keep the girl hidden."},{"T":"301","2":"Xiuyong","3":"So, Uncle Watanabe... I mean, Sir! Are you here to give us a new mission, Sir?"},{"T":"301","2":"Deckard","3":"We have finished mowing and patrolling as you ordered, Sir! We're free to take new missions now!"},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"Smart kids. You're right, I've got a new mission for you."},{"T":"301","3":"Watanabe stands and turns to you with a very friendly wink."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"As you know, this is \u3010kuroname\u3011, our supplier who just arrived."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"Your job is simple\u2014"},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"I'm heading out for the tests very soon. Once I leave with the adults from the combat team, you're in charge of keeping an eye on our supplier from wandering inside our camp. Understood?"},{"T":"302","2":"Hold on, what about our mission?","4":"I... am the mission?"},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"What are you even talking about? The Forsaken never asks a guest in the camp to partake in a mission!"},{"T":"301","3":"Watanabe smiles, slyly."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"More or less. Think of it as a cooperative mission."},{"T":"301","3":"Watanabe shrugs, smiling slyly."},{"T":"301","3":"His comms ring right after he finishes speaking."},{"T":"301","3":"Watanabe turns away from the three curious children, one of his hands spontaneously petting one of their heads."},{"T":"301","2":"Patrol Leader","3":"Sir, the object the supplier brought is ready."},{"T":"301","2":"Patrol Leader","3":"The tests can begin soon. Please come over if you're available. We're about to leave."},{"T":"301","3":"Watanabe just gives him a slight nod before ending the conversation. And then he leans in toward the children again with his serious face."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"Do you understand your missions, Forsaken reserves?"},{"T":"301","2":"Children","3":"Understood! We will complete our task, Sir!"},{"T":"301","3":"Their mannerism is far from the military standard, but the children still sound quite authentic in front of Watanabe."},{"T":"301","3":"Watanabe straightens up, patting the children's heads one by one, then he turns to look at you and speaks again."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"Simply put, you'll stay here with them when we're out collecting data."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"They're an energetic bunch. I'm sure you'll keep each other occupied, and I won't have to worry about you wandering in my camp."},{"T":"302","2":"I'm not a kid!","4":"Are you hiding something here?"},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"See, an adult wouldn't have said that."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"Maybe, maybe not. As your business partner, I simply don't think my supplier needs to go nosing about other people's business."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"Stay awake, stay energized, \u3010kuroname\u3011. Good luck."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"We'll be heading out, and I'll try to get it done as soon as possible. I'll see you later."}]
