[{"T":"301","3":"The next visit you make to Vera's tent happens in a morning."},{"T":"301","3":"You see her hair awkwardly off to the side in a loose ponytail, which seems at odds with how you usually see her."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"\u3010kuroname\u3011. You're awake."},{"T":"301","3":"Seeing you come in, she lets go of her hair and it flows freely."},{"T":"302","2":"Gotta hand it to your TLC...","4":"There's not a single part of me that isn't in pain..."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"You seem re-energized. I take it you want to spend your hard-earned vacation stuck in bed?"},{"T":"302","2":"Forget I said anything..."},{"T":"301","3":"As Vera had said, now that the Corrupted threat to the conservation area has been greatly reduced, the Engineering Force and Task Force have enough manpower to complete their original work as intended. Right before the mission is about to be over, you get to enjoy some much-needed R&R."},{"T":"301","3":"On the first day of your vacation, you visit Vera's tent and run into her right as she appears to be getting ready for hibernation."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Oh, one more thing..."},{"T":"301","3":"You are suddenly eclipsed by a large bouquet of flowers."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Next time, keep your crap to yourself."},{"T":"301","3":"It is a bouquet of wildflowers. Obviously, it is a gift from the Scavengers here. While you were resting in the clinic, your bedside was covered in them. Some may have even come from the Constructs."},{"T":"301","3":"But this time, these flowers are not for you. They are for Vera."},{"T":"301","3":"You just secretly stashed them in here while Vera was out."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"I told you. Saving these people and taking care of their enemies were just a part of the mission."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"If they died because of the Punishing Virus, I'd also be the one responsible for giving them an autopsy in front of everyone. I'd rip them apart more than the Corrupted."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"So, don't give me this crap. I've never understood the point of giving people flowers."},{"T":"302","2":"No, you should take it.","4":"(Throw the flowers back at her)"},{"T":"301","3":"You throw the flowers back to Vera as you tell her."},{"T":"301","3":"You throw the flowers back to Vera without saying a word."},{"T":"301","3":"As expected, the flowers and stems all scatter onto the floor."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"What the hell are you doing? Are you kidding me? I worked so hard to save you and now you're acting like a child. How can you be this childish?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Whatever. The mission is almost over. I don't care what these people think of me."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"I pretended to care at first because I thought it would save me some trouble, but you've been more trouble than the entire conservation area."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"If you want people to praise you here, then have at it. I've had to kick people out while you were getting some rest. I'm sure you can even hear them right now if you go out."},{"T":"302","2":"You've been staying here this whole time?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"I'd be held responsible if I just left and you died here. If that happens, I'm sure Nikola's going to be so pissed that we'd send him to an early grave."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"\u2014Oh, I've got a better idea. Why don't you go get yourself killed right now?"},{"T":"302","2":"Oh, no. Spare me.","4":"Wow! You care so much! I'm so happy!"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"The moment you say this, Vera's disdainful look turns ice cold. Even though Constructs do not eat or experience stomach pain, she looks like she has eaten one of Lucia's culinary creations."},{"T":"302","2":"How's that for a response?","4":"You said the same thing to me."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Looks like you need more time to rest..."},{"T":"302","2":"I'm sorry! I'm sorry!"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Hmph... Since I'm in a good mood, we can save the fun for later."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"I saved your life, now get away from me. Enjoy your vacation."},{"T":"302","2":"You don't want to do anything?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Me? Do what? They all know the real me now. Think I'm interested in having everyone glare at me like some sorta Corrupted while they fawn over how great you are? No, thanks."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"I didn't expect the Gray Raven Commandant to stoop this low, getting enjoyment from torturing me like that."},{"T":"302","2":"About that..."},{"T":"302","2":"I told everyone about you."},{"T":"302","2":"Included the 'Death' bit."},{"T":"301","3":"For a moment, you catch Vera's eyebrows rise stiffly. Her venomous tongue is silent."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"...Is this some sort of revenge?"},{"T":"301","3":"But that was only a moment. The next second, her fierce demeanor returns to her face with more intensity than before."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Whatever. I don't care how they treat me. They mean nothing to me."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"But that's pretty bold of you, \u3010kuroname\u3011."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Is this an act of revenge? Are you done being partners? Or\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"Vera becomes quiet for a moment before carrying on with an intense, threatening tone."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Or are you afraid of me, too?"},{"T":"301","3":"She raises her hand and places it on her banner spear, which has been standing against the side of the tent for the past several days."},{"T":"301","3":"She points the tip at you, whistling as it glides through the air."},{"T":"302","2":"(But you can dodge out of it)","4":"Your next move... is a swipe to the head!"},{"T":"301","3":"You quickly react to the incoming banner spear and avoid the whirlwind despite not having fully recovered from your wounds."},{"T":"301","3":"Step one, a swipe to the head. Step two, a leg sweep. Step three, a thrust to the body. Had she attacked you before the mission, she would have easily defeated you. But you are already wise to her tactics."},{"T":"301","3":"Having danced with the rose over the past several days, you now know how to avoid the thorns."},{"T":"302","2":"Step four, charge!"},{"T":"301","3":"Seeing her banner spear falter a moment, you grab the hilt."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Well, then."},{"T":"301","3":"The moment you grasp the hilt of her banner spear, a look of surprise floats up onto Vera's gorgeous face."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Well done. I underestimated you."},{"T":"302","2":"Seems like I'm getting to know you more.","4":"That's because I already know your combat style."},{"T":"301","3":"Thanks to this mission, you already know how Vera fights in battle."},{"T":"301","3":"Unrestrained and unconcerned with others. But that does not mean that she will reject others' support."},{"T":"301","3":"In reality, her actions are not nearly as random as what she exhibits."},{"T":"301","3":"Roses may be thorny, but the thorns are not everywhere. If you are careful, you can avoid them."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Oh? really?"},{"T":"301","3":"Vera is quiet for a moment and chuckles. As soon as she swings her banner spear, you get pulled toward her."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Can you predict this attack, too?"},{"T":"301","3":"She follows your movement and quickly grabs your hand."},{"T":"301","3":"...Looks like no matter how familiar you are with a rose, a thorn may still catch you off guard."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Didn't you hold that girl's hand like this to comfort her? You did good. You seemed like a real professional."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"What about now? Why don't you show me how professional you really are."},{"T":"301","3":"She begins to clench down on your hand with force, causing your knuckles to start popping."},{"T":"302","2":"Ouch...!","4":"Rgh...! Ouch...!"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Good. Cry louder."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Look! Doesn't that make you a crybaby?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Hurts, doesn't it? A special characteristic of this frame is its high power output. When I first transferred into it, I was accidentally breaking things all the time."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"I can't say that I'm particularly good at controlling it. Maybe if I'm not careful, I'll shatter your arm. You'll have to stay in this hospital bed for another three months. Of course, there isn't any of that inhibitor dispersant crap in Babylonia to save you."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"How about now? Do you know pain? This is how I make Constructs feel. If you don't want to suffer such deadly pain ever again, I recommend you stay the hell away from me."},{"T":"302","2":"But..."},{"T":"302","2":"Doesn't this pain prove that they're living?"},{"T":"302","2":"The 'Death' who gave them such proof should not be treated like this."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"Without a word, Vera just gradually increases her strength. You hear the sound of your wrist cracking."},{"T":"302","2":"(My arm's going to break!)","4":"(My arm... My commandant power!)"},{"T":"301","2":"Scavenger Girl","3":"Miss! Miss!"},{"T":"301","3":"A tender voice saves you from the possibility of your arm breaking. The little girl you saw in this tent earlier stands at the entrance as she shouts over to the two of you."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"What?"},{"T":"301","3":"Vera maintains her vice grip on your arm. Her head does not turn to look at the girl."},{"T":"301","2":"Scavenger Girl","3":"Miss Death, h-hurry! My grandma has a gift for you!"},{"T":"301","3":"Hearing the girl call her by her nickname, Vera's grip loosens for a moment."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Hmph."},{"T":"301","3":"Then, reluctantly, she throws your hand to the side and follows the girl out of the tent."},{"T":"301","3":"The sun finally comes out for the first time after days of haze covering the conservation area. The sunlight is bright and warm, but also gentle."},{"T":"301","2":"Scavenger Girl","3":"Miss, you saved me. I haven't said thank you."},{"T":"301","2":"Scavenger Girl","3":"I heard Commandant \u3010kuroname\u3011 say that your nickname is Death. Is that right, Miss?"},{"T":"301","2":"Scavenger Girl","3":"Grandma says that Death is the one who controls life and death. I'm very glad you didn't choose for me to die, Miss."},{"T":"301","3":"The little girl's voice is frail, having not fully recovered from her illness. She cautiously smiles at Vera, which compliments the wildflowers in her arms."},{"T":"301","3":"Vera quietly follows her with a solemn expression on her face. The Constructs and Scavengers seem to be blown back a few steps by the contrasting presence of the pair."},{"T":"301","3":"By chance, you catch two Constructs whispering."},{"T":"301","2":"Construct A","3":"She seemed really dignified when I first saw her. I can't believe she's the legendary Death..."},{"T":"301","2":"Construct B","3":"I had my doubts before \u3010kuroname\u3011 said anything... Aren't you afraid of her being here?"},{"T":"301","2":"Construct A","3":"I was afraid at first, but seeing her in person isn't much better."},{"T":"301","2":"Construct A","3":"But... seeing how she desperately saved \u3010kuroname\u3011, I was more in awe than afraid. Maybe she's always like that when on a mission."},{"T":"301","2":"Construct A","3":"If you think about it, the only targets she kills are mission objectives... Can we really hate doctors and soldiers on our side like that?"},{"T":"301","3":"Their conversation fades into the distance. It is faint, but you can still hear them."},{"T":"301","3":"Vera seems not to hear the entire conversation. She just follows the girl, who stops in front of an elderly woman. The woman is sitting on the ground with petals scattered around her feet."},{"T":"301","2":"Scavenger Elder","3":"I heard you're 'Death' from those Babylonia folks?"},{"T":"301","2":"Scavenger Elder","3":"Hehe, that's an interesting name. When I was young, I was also called the Colorful Black Dahlia."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"(Chuckles)"},{"T":"301","3":"You do not know whether it is an illusion or something else. Vera's expression remains unchanged, but you somehow manage to hear a strange laugh."},{"T":"301","2":"Scavenger Elder","3":"Haha! You see, nicknames can carry many different meanings. Many of which might have nothing to do with you. No one should use this to define people."},{"T":"301","2":"Scavenger Girl","3":"Yeah! We can give each other lots of nicknames..."},{"T":"301","2":"Scavenger Girl","3":"Well, Miss, your name is Death. What about me? How about... Bread Angel? Or Noodle Angel? I've been wanting bread ever since before I came to the conservation area."},{"T":"301","2":"Scavenger Girl","3":"Alright! I'm the Bread Angel! So... What about \u3010kuroname\u3011? How about the God of Resurrection..."},{"T":"302","2":"Sounds good!","4":"Is there really a god like that?"},{"T":"301","2":"Scavenger Girl","3":"Alright, yeah! Actually... I don't know if there is a God of Resurrection. But if there is one for Death, there has to be one for Life, right? Otherwise, how lonely it'd be..."},{"T":"301","2":"Scavenger Girl","3":"Um, uh... I'm not sure. But if there is one for Death, there has to be one for Life, right? Otherwise, how lonely it'd be..."},{"T":"301","2":"Scavenger Girl","3":"Anyway! This is the gift we wanted to give you, Miss Death! Of course, \u3010kuroname\u3011 gets a gift too!"},{"T":"301","3":"Saying this, the girl holds up a small wreath of flowers."},{"T":"301","3":"It is a wreath woven with wildflowers around the conservation area, with a small glass tube tied in it. The vibrant green is shining in the sunlight."},{"T":"302","2":"Fresh flowers, praise, and a charm."},{"T":"302","2":"This is the treatment 'Death' deserves."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Hmph..."},{"T":"301","3":"Vera hooks her finger over the wreath and throws it several times in the air. She stares at the arc drawn by the bright light reflected from the glass tube, too distracted to wear it."},{"T":"301","3":"She suddenly shakes her hand and straightens her fingers, sending the wreath flying at your head."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Hey. Put it on."},{"T":"301","3":"She orders you in her usual, unquestionably tone."},{"T":"302","2":"M-me?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Look how dumb it is. Suits you."},{"T":"301","3":"There is no reason to oppose her request. All you can do with it is wear it on your head."},{"T":"302","2":"What do you think?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Hehe, not bad. Not bad at all."},{"T":"302","2":"Me or the wreath?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Who knows?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Maybe in the future, I'll give you something more than a wreath."},{"T":"302","2":"Come again?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"As you know, Constructs have many secrets. These secrets bear too heavy of a burden to carry alone. Some may need to be shared with some innocent bystander."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Yes, for example, a strange commandant who foolishly believes or pretends to believe everything a certain Construct says\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"Vera suddenly turns her head and gives you a foreboding smile."},{"T":"301","3":"Panic fills your mind for a moment. Is she going to tell more lies and do more crazy nonsense that will make your hair stand on end?"},{"T":"301","3":"Or will she simply do nothing and revel in your panic?"},{"T":"301","3":"\u2014After a few seconds, she still continues to smile at you, unflinching. In fact, her smile has never been out of good intentions."},{"T":"301","3":"Somehow, this panic gradually changes into a sense of peace."},{"T":"301","3":"If she is going to lie, you will just continue to be skeptical. If she intends to frighten you, you should be prepared to be frightened."},{"T":"301","3":"In any case, this thorny rose seems to be willing to retract her thorns and allow you to get closer."}]
