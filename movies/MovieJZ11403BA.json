That mad narwhal is still rollin' and flailin' about?"},{"T":"301","3":"Discordant noises travel over from the market entrance."},{"T":"301","2":"Port Manager","3":"Not yet... If we don't take it out while it's in the harbor, it'll just come back again and again."},{"T":"301","2":"Fisher","3":"Some fine job 'em Forest Guards are doin'... Useless pricks."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Are you guys talking about... the mechanical narwhal?"},{"T":"301","2":"Port Manager","3":"What other narwhal is there?

You all are just selfish!"},{"T":"301","2":"Fisher","3":"What does a lil' brat like you know!"},{"T":"301","3":"The fisherman could no longer control his temper and rushes over to grab Rosetta. However, Rosetta quickly catches his wrist and twists it behind his back."},{"T":"301","2":"Fisher","3":"Ow! You lil' sardine! Damn it! Let go!"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"I won't let you go unless you apologize to the Guardian Spirit and to us!"},{"T":"301","2":"Port Manager","3":"Damn it!"},{"T":"301","3":"The port manager could no longer take it. He clenches his fist to swing at Rosetta."},{"T":"301","3":"However, his punch is stopped mid-swing by the steel grip of an old but firm hand."},{"T":"301","2":"Pfaff","3":"She's my granddaughter. Just a child. Don't be so hard on her, big guy."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Grandpa!"},{"T":"301","3":"The port manager shakes off Pfaff. At the sight of Pfaff, Rosetta lets go of the fisherman."},{"T":"301","2":"Port Manager","3":"Pah... You're that weird old man living in the forest."},{"T":"301","2":"Fisher","3":"Bloody outsiders! Ruthless savages, the lot of you..."},{"T":"301","2":"Fisher","3":"Call the guards and have 'em jailed! Jailed!"},{"T":"301","3":"Pfaff shields Rosetta behind the rowdy crowd.

An ol' man with one foot inna grave thinks he can kill the whale? Quit joking around!"},{"T":"301","3":"The mocking laughter of the crowd resumes, but Pfaff seems to pay no mind. He pushes his way through the crowd, coming before the port manager."},{"T":"301","2":"Port Manager","3":"What makes you think you can kill the narwhal?"},{"T":"301","3":"Pfaff lowers his voice so that only the port manager could hear. At his words, the manager stiffens and takes on a solemn expression."},{"T":"301","2":"Port Manager","3":"Are you serious...? This is too much for a joke."},{"T":"301","2":"Pfaff","3":"I stake my life on it."},{"T":"301","2":"Port Manager","3":"Hmph, your life means little to me. But..."},{"T":"301","3":"The manager shifts his gaze at the Rosetta behind Pfaff. For this little girl, the old man would never lie."},{"T":"301","2":"Port Manager","3":"Alright, fine. I will inform the captain."},{"T":"301","2":"Port Manager","3":"But remember... If you fail, you will bear all the consequences.

He grabs Rosetta's hand and leaves the port under the gazes of the crowd."},{"T":"301","2":"Pfaff","3":"Is there something you want to say?"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Grandpa, didn't you say that the narwhal was the Guardian Spirit of humanity?! Why are you killing it? I don't get it!"},{"T":"301","3":"Pfaff sighs. The steam from his breath escapes into the snowy forest."},{"T":"301","2":"Pfaff","3":"It's okay. You don't need to understand. Just know that this is my decision. That's all."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"The thing about the Guardian Spirit protecting us\u2014protecting humanity... Was it all a lie?"},{"T":"301","2":"Pfaff","3":"Rosetta, it's just a mechanical narwhal. You are a human; you need human friends."},{"T":"301","3":"Rosetta is about to retort, but Pfaff quickly interrupts her."},{"T":"301","2":"Pfaff","3":"I'll set out tomorrow morning. If I don't return in a month, run. Go as far as you can into the forest."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Grandpa..."},{"T":"301","3":"Waking up next morning, Pfaff finds Rosetta gone."},{"T":"301","2":"Pfaff","3":"Rosetta! No, it couldn't be..."},{"T":"301","3":"Pfaff immediately packs his gear and rushes to the seashore for departure."},{"T":"301","3":"To his surprise, Rosetta is waiting there with her spear."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Grandpa, even if you don't tell me what you plan on doing, I wanna help you at least."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"If you're gonna kill the Guardian Spirit, I wanna be a witness to it!"},{"T":"301","3":"Pfaff stares at Rosetta bitterly.
