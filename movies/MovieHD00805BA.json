[{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"Ah... here it is."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"...No one's here, it seems. I can probably just... put this here..."},{"T":"301","3":"Ayla moves lightly, placing the fortune bag with the couplets on the table."},{"T":"301","3":"Looking around, she can hardly find a flattering spot in the Strike Hawk's lounge."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"It's not a good habit to judge others' aesthetics, but, still... sigh."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Sorry, Ayla, if this is too embarrassing. I simply prefer my lounge to be as simple as possible."},{"T":"301","3":"Ayla is not surprised to hear Chrome's voice behind her."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"You're a captain. Defend yourself, at the very least."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"I was the one who ordered the decorations to be taken down\u2014Wanshi, the sleepyhead, kept hitting them when he woke up. It wasn't a big deal for Constructs, sure..."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"But as a captain, you're still worried... I see."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"You're mistaken. Wanshi would use that as an excuse to avoid practice, so I spent some effort replacing all the decorations, and I put all these paddings on the edges and corners of the tables and chairs."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"I... see... Oh, right. I almost forgot."},{"T":"301","3":"Ayla remembers why she is here and hands Chrome the bag she placed on the table."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"I'm actually here on behalf of WGAA to give you this."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Is that so? Do I need to give you a receipt, or something? Allow me."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"Eh, no? You misunderstood. Inside the bags is a pair of couplets from WGAA. They're like decorations for the festival, like... Christmas tree."},{"T":"301","3":"Chrome opens the bag and peeks inside, and he finds two pieces of red paper with words on them."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Couplets, you say? It's Lunar New Year, isn't it? My thanks to WGAA for preparing this."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"Oh? How come you know what they are, Chrome?"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"I read about the festival in a book before. I was quite interested in this form of art, so I still remember bits of it."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"Whoa, I'm so moved! If we can create another person like you, WGAA's effort will not be in vain!"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"That's... a bit hyperbolic, isn't it..."},{"T":"301","3":"As the two of them talk, a tall Construct walks in, looking frustrated."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Capt... Why did you leave me behind... I got caught by old man Nik... I mean, Commander Nikola, and he gave me one hell of a talk..."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"You're right on time. Help me put these couplets up, won't you?"},{"T":"301","3":"Seeing the red sheets in Chrome's hand, Kamui walks closer curiously."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"What?! What are 'couplets'?"},{"T":"301","3":"Chrome gestures to the running Kamui to lower his voice."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Kamui, Wanshi's probably sleeping, so don't wake him up."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"What?! You mean there's someone else here? But... I was knocking, and nobody answered!"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Oh, hi, Ayla! We've met, I think\u2014long time no see!"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"...Looks like we can skip the introduction. And you're right\u2014our third member is here, indeed. But it's that time of the day."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"That time of the day?"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"...For him to sleep."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"A Construct in sleep mode, is it? No wonder no one answered."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Wanshi does that a lot, so don't mind it. By the way, can I open this? Does it come with gifts like the red envelopes?"},{"T":"301","3":"Kamui grabs the fortune bag from Chrome as he speaks and looks inside with anticipation."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"Of course! It's for you!"},{"T":"301","3":"With a bit of rustling, Kamui opens the bag and looks at the beautifully written couplets in his hands, his head tilted in confusion."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"It's just... pretty red paper, Capt.?"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"And there are only two pieces, but... there are three of us!"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"This isn't a gift for us personally. They're decors for the room."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"It's a tradition from the ancient East. Although we're still not sure what their application is, the words written on them are all beautiful blessings."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"In the past, the people in the East would put these couplets up outside the door during Springtime as a way to wish for good luck in the coming year!"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Ah, I see! If this will make our dreams come true... Capt., Ayla, can I decide where to place it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"I don't need it in my room, so... it's fine by me."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"How about you, Ayla? Please let me handle this!"},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"I'm supposed to give it to you to handle it, so of course\u2014you have your captain's permission. You can do it."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Capt., Ayla, I will make sure to put the couplets and their intentions to good use!"},{"T":"301","3":"Kamui grins as he walks toward Wanshi's sleeping pod."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"An item to make our dreams come true... Obviously, it belongs to the one who sleeps the most!"}]
