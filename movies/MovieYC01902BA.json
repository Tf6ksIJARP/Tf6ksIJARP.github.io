The foundations were already in place."},{"T":"301","2":"\u03b1","3":"That's right, the harsh environment plays a huge part in all of this. There's nothing but fish and a handful of local products.

Do you mean to say there are people here who are able to support the research on Babylonia?"},{"T":"301","3":"Hearing what could be a clue, Alpha tightens her grip on her weapon and her voice takes on a serious tone."},{"T":"301","2":"Murol","3":"I don't know much about the research technology, but I did wake up in the military post over there."},{"T":"301","2":"Murol","3":"Agreeing on a contract and awakening us...
