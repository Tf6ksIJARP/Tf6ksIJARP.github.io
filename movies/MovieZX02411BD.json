[{"T":"301","3":"As the sailor explains it, you imagine what must have happened back then."},{"T":"301","3":"The sailboat travels along the route as expected. It is a cold, humid night. The sea mist gets heavier as it becomes harder to see the looks on people's faces."},{"T":"301","3":"In the first two days after the ark sets sail, all the passengers on the boat try desperately to fit into the limited space."},{"T":"301","3":"They escape the evil dragon's attack. The port is on fire and smoking as smog rises into the sky. Together, the people on the boat speculate on the situation. Perhaps the army is here. Perhaps there was an ugly battle. Or, perhaps, it was a one-sided fight where the evil dragon slaughtered all the land creatures."},{"T":"301","3":"It takes five days after barely escaping death for the people to realize this journey doesn't have a destination. Their boat must sail on and on. They are not prepared for this at all."},{"T":"301","3":"It never rains but it pours. People need space, food, and clean water to live. And as time passes, these resources will run out, and eventually, people will die."},{"T":"301","3":"Just like critters that are vulnerable to the coming winter, the people cherish their last remaining supplies and remain vigilant of every subtle movement around them."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"Then, I realized there were children and even infants on the boat."},{"T":"301","3":"It is very clear there is a great price to be paid to keep these kids on the boat."},{"T":"301","3":"And the survivors are worried and anxious because of this situation."},{"T":"301","3":"The fact that these children are holding back their tears and trying their best not to cry proves that. But every subtle voice can draw lots of attention. In an environment like this, people's patience is just as limited as their supplies."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"But something else drew even more attention..."},{"T":"301","3":"The sailor is careful with his choice of words."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"...There was this traveler."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"On the seventh day..."},{"T":"301","3":"Many people start to count how many supplies they have left and chart a route back to the land."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"I patched my wound as quickly as possible. Back then, hiding the wound was more important than treating the wound."},{"T":"301","3":"The sailor pauses for a moment."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"When people were thinking about their own survival, the traveler was doing whatever she could to help others... and tell stories."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"She calmed people down and told stories about an evil dragon and a champion to the crying children at night."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"A few corn kernels could keep a man alive for three days. And a small piece of meat could keep a man alive for five days."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"But what about a story? For how many days could a man live on a story?"},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"Poetry and plays. Yes, those were the words that I racked my brain to finally recall."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"Those were the things that only well-fed nobles would think about."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"Back then, the nobles only knew to cower in their fortified castle. They had armies of armor-clad soldiers to protect them, which gave them the privilege of thinking about what to eat for dinner."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"And what about us?"},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"We are in a desperate situation along with our children."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"But..."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"She decided to tell childish, naive stories about fantasies."},{"T":"301","3":"Their stomachs ache, their lips chap, and their wounds swell and fester. The people in the room are sensitive to every subtle movement around them as if vulnerable critters living in a forest, paying close attention to their surroundings and fearing a predator might be lurking in the shadow."},{"T":"301","3":"People pay attention to the cracks in the door and the coughs at night. They are startled by every sudden whimper and occasional cry. Then, there is also the clear voice whispering fantasy stories."},{"T":"301","3":"The law of the jungle doesn't seem to work on this traveler. Her seemingly magical bedtime stories connect the people who are staying awake at night, including those who are feeling anxious, those who are planning something, and those who dare cry and show their vulnerability."},{"T":"301","3":"'The sun rises from the horizon as always. The night sky is full of shining stars.'"},{"T":"301","3":"The stories work their magic and bring comfort to the crying people. With that, the anxious people no longer have an excuse to take it out on someone else. In a daze, he thinks to himself, perhaps he can spend the night in peace, but he keeps hearing stories."},{"T":"301","3":"Every word is filled with hope, courage, and victory."},{"T":"301","3":"But everywhere he goes, he sees defeated young men that aren't excited about their adventure."},{"T":"301","3":"They are far away from home and drifting at sea without a home to go back to because their home has been burned to the ground."},{"T":"301","3":"They have never witnessed the great power of magic, nor have they ever used their own strength to fight demons."},{"T":"301","3":"The evil dragon is destroying village after village and city after city, but where is the champion?"},{"T":"301","3":"Liar."},{"T":"301","3":"His thought drifts on that idea."},{"T":"301","3":"'Days go by and seasons change. The dragon is dead, and the land has come back to life. People can now live in peace.'"},{"T":"301","3":"Liar."},{"T":"301","3":"As the story ends with a happy ending, the children stop crying."},{"T":"301","3":"Senses become weak when there is a moment of peace and quiet. Fatigue comes rushing in to paralyze his brain that was already having trouble thinking. He hasn't slept so well in a while."},{"T":"301","3":"In the dream, there is also an evil dragon that plunges the world into an apocalypse."},{"T":"301","3":"But that world is a little more childish, naive, and impractical, just like a fantasy story."},{"T":"301","3":"The children, who have never been through a rough time before, believe in the fairytale. Their eyes glisten with hope. They even start to run around and have fun on the deck. Together, they cry and yell during the daylight and sleep soundly at night."},{"T":"301","3":"He is like a warrior stationed in a borderland as he keeps watch under the lantern light. But deep down, he knows that he isn't lost at sea. The helmsman's singing voice is low and peaceful. The lyrics are about the distant homeland. Guided by the song, the people on this boat will not lose themselves."},{"T":"301","3":"The traveler waits at the port, waiting for the sailboat to hoist its flag. They are determined to set out on this journey. At this moment, they are all brave champions."},{"T":"301","3":"That night, the young sailor sleeps soundly. This has not happened to him for a very long time."},{"T":"301","3":"And now, the sailor awakes from his dream. The dreams in the past are like reflections in the water, showing a reality he once thought was impossible."},{"T":"301","3":"The sailor turns his attention from the sea to you as he sizes you up."},{"T":"301","3":"After a while, he squints and looks you right in the eyes."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"You are a traveler too, aren't you?"},{"T":"302","2":"...","4":"I don't remember."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"Your eyes remind me of the eyes of the first traveler I met."},{"T":"302","2":"The first traveler?"},{"T":"301","3":"The sailor doesn't answer your question. Instead, he exhales. The cold night makes his breath visible. He looks up into the starry night sky."},{"T":"301","3":"The universe is mesmerizing, and the galaxies are bright, just like a pair of eyes from the past."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"Perhaps you can become the champion."},{"T":"301","3":"Right after he finishes his sentence, the sailor starts laughing. But shortly afterward, he stops laughing and pats your shoulder."}]
