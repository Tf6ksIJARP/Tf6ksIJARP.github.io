Luna did not spell it out loud, but the three Ascendants are fully aware that certain results are expected in this operation."},{"T":"301","3":"As the war rages on in Kowloong, the balance slowly shifts. The Ascendants have occupied quite a few outer areas and turned them into domains of the virus."},{"T":"301","2":"Phecda A","3":"You've been infected, huh? On the orders of Lady Qu, I will grant you a quick death!"},{"T":"301","2":"Phecda B","3":"\u2014!"},{"T":"301","3":"Lamia compresses the virus and discharges it wherever she goes. Just like what Roland said, the Phecda\u2014without Inver-Devices to protect them\u2014are easy hosts for the virus. They quickly join the Corrupted ranks."},{"T":"301","2":"Phecda Leader","3":"Damn it..."},{"T":"301","3":"As the viral density in the area rises, Kowloong's arrogance gives way to angst. They begin to lock down streets to minimize the damage."},{"T":"301","2":"Phecda A","3":"Captain, there's a female Corrupted at the defense line!"},{"T":"301","2":"Phecda Leader","3":"From the way she moves... she's an Ascendant! All units, destroy her!"},{"T":"301","3":"At the Phecda leader's command, all Phecdas snap into action and fire away at Lamia.

Smoke her out!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"No, not a projection, but an illusion. It's bye-bye when you see it."},{"T":"301","2":"Phecda Leader","3":"Ugh... Aaargh!"},{"T":"301","3":"Before the Kowloong guards can scatter, Lamia descends upon them. With a point of her finger, bulges appear on their bodies and quickly spread over like rashes."},{"T":"301","3":"A Lamia specialty\u2014using the Punishing Virus to paralyze a frame's control systems."},{"T":"301","3":"The virus spreads amid anguished cries, but Lamia does not seem the least bothered by the screams. Instead, a stricken expression overtakes her."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"This is exhausting... Those explosions too, it must have been Gabriel...

I can just... go home first...?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"...Naw, that won't do. They'll be mad..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"Someone's coming this way along the train tracks... Must be that Akdilek they mentioned earlier... How did Babylonia manage to bring all these people together?"},{"T":"301","3":"As Lamia ruminates on her growing troubles, her expression darkens.
