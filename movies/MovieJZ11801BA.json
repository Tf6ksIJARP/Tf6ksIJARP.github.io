Wanshi changes into dustproof clothes and stands in the center of the maintenance room. An assistant approaches him at that moment."},{"T":"301","2":"Assistant A","3":"Doctor Wanshi, a Construct was taken to maintenance room 13."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Turn on data projection."},{"T":"301","3":"Wanshi nods as he looks at the scan of the Construct in maintenance room 13 and says to the assistant."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"The auxiliary circulatory system of the lower chamber is damaged. Help me start the remote maintenance kit in maintenance room 13."},{"T":"301","2":"Assistant A","3":"Huh, but that would take a huge toll on your mind."},{"T":"301","3":"Wanshi takes several connecting wires from the kit terminal aside and attaches them to his head, ignoring the assistant's persuasion."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Testing connection."},{"T":"301","3":"The view of maintenance room 13 is revealed by the kit terminal, several robotic arms lifting the maintenance tools in turn under Wanshi's control.

We'll fix them at the same time."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Maintenance over. I'll leave the module 'stitiching' to you."},{"T":"301","3":"Wanshi pushes the maintenance tools aside.

I'm okay."},{"T":"301","2":"Assistant B","3":"It seems that you are much more serious when it comes to maintenance, Doctor."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Is that so... I didn't feel any different."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Constructs can feel pain just as well as humans.
