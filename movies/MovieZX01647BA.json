I'm your brother\u2014don't you recognize me?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Then explain to me why I couldn't get past the signal blockade when I tried to reach Babylonia since we've gotten Huaxu's key, when you, who are apparently in Babylonia, can suddenly contact us?"},{"T":"301","2":"'Murray'","3":"It's... probably..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"The first time I felt suspicious was when I mentioned the graviton detector.
