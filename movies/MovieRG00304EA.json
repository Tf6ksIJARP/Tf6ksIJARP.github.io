[{"T":"301","3":"After going through a lot of hardship (majority of which came from the other three teammates), we finally arrived at the palace."},{"T":"301","3":"All the NPCs and enemies here seemed to be configured by Celica. In particular, the people we knew would become NPCs even if they were not actually in the game..."},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"Oh, you must be the heroes who travelled from afar. Welcome!"},{"T":"301","3":"Hassen became a king."},{"T":"301","2":"Karenina","3":"Oh, it's Hassen. I thought Celica would put Nikola here."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Hah... I really hate him. He's way too serious."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Hassen... Kamui remembers him as a one-eyed mid-aged man. Yeah, one eye only."},{"T":"301","3":"Three of them openly expressed their opinions on the King (Hassen) as he spoke, completely ignoring the guards and the King himself."},{"T":"301","2":"Guard","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"A few guards seemed to be upset with their words and clenched their weapons."},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"Haha, very interesting. My name is Hassen indeed, but you should always address me as the King."},{"T":"301","2":"Karenina","3":"Really? You? A king?"},{"T":"301","3":"The King (Hassen) was kind enough and tried to make the situation less awkward, but Karenina's reply almost made him fall off the throne."},{"T":"301","3":"The guards immediately stepped forward with a fierce look."},{"T":"302","2":"Can't you just be a bit nicer?!","4":"My apologies, Your Majesty! Please forgive our rudeness. We come from a rural town."},{"T":"301","2":"Karenina","3":"What do you mean by 'nice'? We aren't here for small talks!"},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"Haha, I see. I can't blame you then."},{"T":"301","3":"The King (Hassen) perfectly understood my intention and stopped his guards."},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"Oh, you look like a trustworthy one. I guess you are the leader. What's your name?"},{"T":"302","2":"(Tell him your name)"},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"\u3010kuroname\u3011. I'll remember your name, hero."},{"T":"301","2":"Karenina","3":"How did Gray Raven's Commandant become our leader?"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Whatever, I don't care. When are you going to give us our task, Hassen?"},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"Ahem, I didn't have the chance. But before that, I'd like to tell you the history of the Land of Overlord, and how we fought the disgusting Demons for a hundred years..."},{"T":"302","2":"(Keep listening to him)","4":"The Land of Overlord?"},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"Yeah, that's the name of this land. I know it's a bit awkward, haha..."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Who cares. It's always the same story, Demons invaded the land, and the people suffered. Just give me the task already!"},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"Um, you have a great understanding of our history. Alright, I'll skip to the quest."},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"...Actually, our Princess Liv was taken away by the Demon King."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Wait a sec, did you say Liv?"},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"Yeah, I did. Is there a problem?"},{"T":"301","3":"Camu interrupted Hassen. He looked shocked."},{"T":"302","2":"Is this normal?","4":"Has she really been caught?"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"No, it isn't."},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"It's true."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Celica explained this game to me and Kamui. She said there wouldn't be any NPCs that looked the same as the players."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Does that mean Liv has been captured by the Demon King in the game? She's even become a princess... What kind of joke is this?"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"It sounds weird to us, but it should be a perfectly normal thing to the game NPCs."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Well, Hassen, I have another question. Has any other hero, apart from us, visited this place?"},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"No, why?"},{"T":"301","3":"According to Hassen, Lucia and other Gray Raven members had never been here... I knew it wasn't possible, but I still imagined them being caught by the Demon King."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Commandant, you were thinking they might be caught up together, right? That would be really fun, but I don't think it's possible."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"'Karenina, Camu, pack up your gears. Lucia and others are probably behind us.'"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Let's find and beat the Demon King first, so we can get Liv back and win this game."},{"T":"301","2":"Karenina","3":"Why are you giving orders?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Hmph, whatever. The game may be having errors, but we must win no matter what."},{"T":"301","3":"We agreed on the objective of saving Liv, but this team didn't seem to be concerned at all that an ally was taken by the enemy."},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"Wait, heroes! Please take this map before you head out!"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"What's this...?"},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"The Princess is in the Demon King's Castle. To get there, you must defeat the Demon Generals to weaken the defense. You can try to break in by force, but we don't even know the exact location of the castle before you break its defense."},{"T":"301","2":"Karenina","3":"Such old-fashioned settings..."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Are you saying we have to fight some big four evil generals before going to the Demon King's Castle?"},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"I'm glad that you have understood the situation, heroes."},{"T":"302","2":"Have you marked the location of Demon Generals on the map?","4":"Is there anything else you haven't told us?"},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"Yes, we have marked them all."},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"That's all we know so far."},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"We are counting on you, heroes."}]
