[{"T":"301","3":"All of you have brought your crafts with you when you meet again."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"Let me see... Woah, they look amazing!"},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"Excellent, it can surely pass the pre-selection. Come, this way."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"Just hand in your crafts, and you'll get the VIP tickets."},{"T":"301","2":"Sophia","3":"Time to watch the mechanic puppet show."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"A show..."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"Wouldn't it be a pity if some art forms were only stored as data? It's the mission of Kowloong to recreate them in the real world."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"Besides, it can attract more guests this way. Pretty smart plan, right?"},{"T":"301","3":"Led by the three, you and the others make your way to the pre-selection stage and exchange the crafts for VIP tickets."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Great, we've passed the pre-selection."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"I know you'll make it."},{"T":"301","3":"The four of you put the tickets on the machine. The light curtain in the front melts, revealing a glittering stage."},{"T":"301","3":"A mechanical puppet is spinning a wooden wheel in the middle of the stage."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"Just in time, the show has just started."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"What is that?"},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"A spinning wheel, which is used to spin threads according to the records in the data."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"In the past, people needed to use the spinning wheel to twist the materials into a string before weaving them into cloth."},{"T":"301","3":"The mechanical puppet who is spinning threads stands up with the music, and follows several similarly dressed mechanical puppets up the steps projecting the clouds. The surrounding scenery changes into a lake."},{"T":"301","3":"Gradually, people with different expressions gather around the stage. They all remain quiet while watching the mechanical puppets perform."},{"T":"301","3":"The spinning mechanical puppet falls in love with a shabby-looking puppet, but the two of them are forced to separate amidst a thunderstorm on the stage."},{"T":"301","3":"To get together again, the puppet slaughters a mechanical cow and tears off its cowhide. Having given up everything, he runs to the sky with his child."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Poor them... Why can't people who love each other be reunited, even in a story?"},{"T":"302","2":"Because stories are based on reality."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Based on reality..."},{"T":"301","2":"Yazi","3":"It's the same way in reality. People who love each other will always be separated."},{"T":"301","3":"Yazi has been standing behind everyone for some time."},{"T":"301","2":"Yazi","3":"...The same happened to 'Qu'."},{"T":"302","2":"If there's a choice..."},{"T":"301","2":"Yazi","3":"Indeed. If they had a choice, they'd be standing here today."},{"T":"301","3":"Yazi turns back. Her mask is silent like a rock smoothed out by a river stream, hiding all emotions beneath it."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"If there's a choice..."},{"T":"301","3":"Liv recites the sentence silently, as if remembering something of the past that she does not want to recall."},{"T":"301","3":"The mechanical puppets on the stage are separated by the Milky Way amidst the sad music, creeping on the shore, trying to reach out to each other."},{"T":"301","2":"Yazi","3":"The story was set from the moment they were born as the cowherd and the weaving maid."},{"T":"301","2":"Yazi","3":"They think they can change the future through their struggles, but the truth is that they've merely chosen the path that hurts the least."},{"T":"301","2":"Yazi","3":"Or, the path that must be trodden, no matter the cost."},{"T":"302","2":"Are you talking about 'Qu'?","4":"Is this about you?"},{"T":"301","3":"The floor of the stage turns into a bridge made of magpies in the projection. Upon such a touching scene, Yazi lets out a bitter smile."},{"T":"301","2":"Yazi","3":"Is it important? They'll never be apart anymore, yet I'll always be here."},{"T":"301","3":"The mechanical puppets hug and cry on the magpie bridge. The audience under the stage bursts into applause. Eventually, some begin to stand up and leave."},{"T":"302","2":"Never be apart...?"},{"T":"301","3":"Yazi does not answer your question. She simply joins the crowd of departing people."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Though the M.I.N.D. of 'Qu' and Huaxu were damaged, they were also merged in such a way that's inseparable."},{"T":"302","2":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Is that freedom?"},{"T":"302","2":"They made their choice."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Even if it means they have to end up like this?"},{"T":"302","2":"Yeah."},{"T":"301","3":"Liv lowers her head thoughtfully."},{"T":"302","2":"What's on your mind?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"It's nothing..."},{"T":"301","3":"She looks up with a gentle, but enigmatic smile."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"At least... not now. I can't tell you something uncertain."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"...?"},{"T":"302","2":"Feel free to tell me...","4":"Whenever you're ready."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Alright."},{"T":"301","3":"At this moment, a loud discussion breaks out."},{"T":"301","2":"Sophia","3":"The lucky draw is about to begin."},{"T":"301","3":"A projection screen rises in the middle of the stage, gradually revealing the list of prizes for this draw."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"There are ten Lucky Prizes... the winners can choose any two pieces of crafts."},{"T":"301","2":"Crowds","3":"Aren't those the crafts we handed over? What's the point?"},{"T":"301","2":"Crowds","3":"Because it's just the Lucky Prize, I guess."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"The third prize seems to be the chance to shake hands with Miss Pulao."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"Haha... It's just to... save money."},{"T":"301","2":"Crowds","3":"That's the third prize?"},{"T":"301","2":"Crowds","3":"I'll have it if you don't want it. I'd love to meet the Kowloong Crew!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"The second prize is a collection of guqin pieces played by Yazi herself?"},{"T":"301","2":"Crowds","3":"Hey! Look at the first prize!"},{"T":"301","3":"The first prize on the screen is, as Changyu originally said, a million grubs."},{"T":"301","2":"Crowds","3":"That's miles different from the other prizes!"},{"T":"301","2":"Crowds","3":"It's the prize that drew me to make the craft!"},{"T":"301","2":"Crowds","3":"Please, let it be me. Come on, ticket, you're the hope I've been waiting for!"},{"T":"301","3":"However, underneath the text 'A Million Grubs' seems to be a small line of fine print."},{"T":"302","2":"'Only if certain conditions are met.'","4":"...?"},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"Please... please don't be \u3010kuroname\u3011..."},{"T":"301","3":"Pulao folds her hands, as if praying for something."},{"T":"301","3":"Afterward, the lotto numbers chosen by the ticket holders appear on the screen one after another, and the crowd falls silent."},{"T":"301","2":"System Notice","3":"Announcing the winners of the ten Lucky Prizes!"},{"T":"301","3":"With ten numbers appearing on the screen, murmurs arise in the crowd."},{"T":"301","2":"Crowds","3":"Well, better than nothing."},{"T":"301","2":"Crowds","3":"Let's go."},{"T":"301","3":"The winners of the third and second prizes are then revealed. None of the Gray Ravens' ticket numbers are shown on the screen."},{"T":"302","2":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"System Notice","3":"Announcing the winner of the first prize! Who is our lucky person going to be?"},{"T":"301","3":"The projection screen flashes up in a dazzling light. After a burst of music, an unfamiliar number appears in the center."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"It's not one of us..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"The odds are just too small based on the number of people participating in the lucky draw."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Better luck next time."},{"T":"301","3":"The crowd leaves in sighs. Changyu and Sophia stand up and wave at Pulao."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"Good, now it's a sure bet."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"I'll leave the award ceremony to you. After all, you're the only one who can control it."},{"T":"302","2":"...?"},{"T":"301","2":"Sophia","3":"Bye."},{"T":"301","3":"After the two leave, Pulao sighs in relief and steps onto the stage to greet the winning craftsman."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"...Let's congratulate our lucky winner."},{"T":"301","3":"Slightly nervous, she welcomes the winner onto the stage."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"Please welcome the presenters..."},{"T":"301","3":"Several heavily armored mechanical guards step on the stage."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"Now, a million grubs will be yours after you defeat them."},{"T":"301","2":"Winner","3":"What's that about?
