How 'nostalgic'..."},{"T":"301","3":"Vera raises her hand, and all the soldiers hold their breaths just from this one simple motion."},{"T":"301","3":"Everyone is expecting her to draw her sword, but she does not.

Curiously, they are not aiming at you either. Instead..."},{"T":"301","3":"\u2014First, you hear a loud crash."},{"T":"301","3":"You hear a piercing 'SLASH' after that. The sound of the flesh and bones of the metal box housing you being slit."},{"T":"301","3":"An opening appears on the black box around you. Bright light immediately floods in."},{"T":"301","3":"Within the blinding light, you see a burst of violent red."},{"T":"301","3":"Your eyes have adjusted to the dark for so long that they are not prepared for this burst of brightness. Your vision and mind go blank for a second."},{"T":"301","3":"In that brief moment, that rosy red rushes to your side like a gush of wind."},{"T":"301","3":"Slippery like a fish and quick like lightning, she swings her blade unceasingly. The cold hue of her blade blossoms into a blooming flower in the air."},{"T":"301","3":"A strike immediately follows another. Her move is so fast that her blade leaves behind a continuous trail of light."},{"T":"301","3":"Everywhere this flash of thunderbolt touches, a Kurono soldier falls. But her blade does not stop as it slashes across the room\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"Toward the person bounded on a chair\u2014none other than you!"},{"T":"301","3":"The stream of wind it carries reaches you before its blade."},{"T":"301","3":"You close your eyes subconsciously, expecting the pain to hit, but it does not. Instead, you hear a loud 'CLANG!', the sound of metal hitting metal."},{"T":"301","3":"Slowly you open your eyes, your vision finally adjusting to the brightness."},{"T":"301","3":"The first thing you see is the iron chain attached to your legs cut into two. Then you notice the blade that separates it is still pinned in front of you."},{"T":"301","3":"The blade wielder's force is so strong that its point is buried deep into the ground. The sword is still rattling, its hum lingering in the air."},{"T":"301","3":"You follow the sword and look up... and you find a familiar figure standing before you."},{"T":"301","3":"You cannot help yourself but utter her name."},{"T":"302","2":"Vera."},{"T":"301","3":"Vera, facing away from the light, stands there, the corner of her mouth gently raised."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Hello there, Gray Raven Commandant. It's been a while."},{"T":"301","3":"Her tone is calm as if you are greeting after running into each other on a lazy afternoon."},{"T":"301","3":"\u2014As long as you can ignore the unconscious Kurono Constructs under her feet."},{"T":"301","3":"Her tone soon shifts back to the aggressive hostility you are familiar with."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"What's wrong? Did I make you piss your pants?"},{"T":"301","3":"Before you can answer, she is already tossing the Constructs outside the opening one by one with a sneer."},{"T":"301","3":"A hound on a mission does not relax until all her objectives are fulfilled."},{"T":"302","2":"Where are we exactly?","4":"Why are you here?"},{"T":"301","3":"Having 'emptied' the room, Vera pauses for a second."},{"T":"301","3":"Slowly she turns her head toward you, seemingly about to answer your question."},{"T":"301","3":"But then, the loud crackling of engines in the distance causes her expression to shift drastically. She stops smiling."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Sometimes it's amazing how dense you are."},{"T":"301","3":"She walks toward you as she speaks. Swiftly she retrieves the blade nailed to the ground before cutting open another metal wall of the room."},{"T":"301","3":"You find the cabin of a transport craft on the other side of the opening."},{"T":"302","2":"This is..."},{"T":"301","3":"You look back at the forest bathed under moonlight outside the walls. The branches of the trees rattle in the wind."},{"T":"301","3":"Babylonia would never waste that many resources on green spaces, not to mention simulating natural wind."},{"T":"301","3":"Everything you are seeing points to one fact\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"You are on Earth."},{"T":"301","3":"But why?"},{"T":"301","3":"You were on Babylonia before the remote connection. How are you inside a transport craft on Earth all of a sudden?"},{"T":"301","3":"Instantly, the sense of dissonance you have been ignoring finally adds up."},{"T":"301","3":"The perplexing remote connection that took longer than usual."},{"T":"301","3":"The fact that Rebecca was contacting you with comms after your first face-to-face meeting."},{"T":"301","3":"And the intermittent quakes beneath your feet."},{"T":"301","3":"Noticing your look of epiphany, Vera shows you a look of disgust."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Only now do you notice it? Come on, Gray Raven Commandant."},{"T":"301","3":"You have been transported to Earth since your first remote connection."},{"T":"301","3":"They have replicated the dark room they caged you on this transport craft to create the illusion that you were not moved."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"I've taken down most of the Kurono Constructs on my way here, but their reinforcement will arrive soon."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Go close the rear door. I've only torn apart this room, not the craft itself."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"I'm going to fly the plane now. Time to bolt."},{"T":"301","3":"With that, she steps inside the cockpit, no longer communicating with you."},{"T":"301","3":"The red-haired Construct has been blazing around you like a fire. Only until she disappears from your side that you can finally smell the scent of crossing swords she has left behind."},{"T":"301","3":"The door to the study opens."},{"T":"301","3":"All Collins does is raise his eyebrows."},{"T":"301","3":"Despite his guest arriving unprompted, Collins knows that his address is only known to a selected few, accessible to fewer. He is not worried about his safety. Someone who can arrive safely must be one of his."},{"T":"301","3":"Indeed. It is Rebecca at his door."},{"T":"301","3":"Her chest rises and falls from her heavy breaths, her usually elegant appearance slightly unkempt. It is apparent that she was in a hurry and unable to bother with how she looked."},{"T":"301","3":"This is unusual for Rebecca. Someone like her cares for how she presents herself."},{"T":"301","3":"Unless things are so dire that she cannot afford to do so."},{"T":"301","3":"Collins straightens himself while Rebecca has already arrived before him, her high heel shoes clicking."},{"T":"301","2":"Rebecca","3":"What was that you got from the Chief Commander? The Gray Raven Commandant just got rescued by the Cerberus captain! Your plan to sneak the commandant away has backfired!"},{"T":"301","3":"Collins pauses for a second before he starts laughing."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Ahahaha... I can't believe it! Nicky actually did it..."},{"T":"301","3":"Stupefied, Rebecca stares at the man before her, who laughs so hard he almost runs out of breath, and she stands there, confused."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"At least our socialite here has stopped pretending to be neutral."},{"T":"301","3":"Rebecca instantly understands that he is mocking how she has been playing both sides."},{"T":"301","3":"She takes another deep breath and continues."},{"T":"301","2":"Rebecca","3":"The only good news is that we have detained the other two Cerberus members. One of them was connected with the commandant for a long period of time, and her M.I.N.D. showed unusual activities during the mission."},{"T":"301","2":"Rebecca","3":"As long as we retrieve her and analyze her M.I.N.D., our mission is not a total failure... Why the hell are you not nervous at all?!"},{"T":"301","3":"Collins answers her with a question."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"What was the objective of this operation?"},{"T":"301","3":"This time, it is Rebecca who pauses."},{"T":"301","3":"The objective? She ponders. On the surface, it was to utilize the Gray Raven Commandant to investigate what appeared to be Luna's M.I.N.D. activities and locate her."},{"T":"301","3":"That was what she thought as well, in the beginning."},{"T":"301","3":"But things apparently are not what they seem. Collins promised to return the Gray Raven Commandant to the Parliament, yet he tried to move the commandant behind their back, meaning he wanted to hold on to this asset."},{"T":"301","3":"Kurono is not known for leniency. Rebecca even thought that Collins would come up with more ways to counter the Parliament after the mission."},{"T":"301","3":"The reason he has his eyes on the Gray Raven Commandant is simply that the commandant has the potential to connect to an agent without getting their consciousness corrupted."},{"T":"301","3":"Of course the Parliament would not believe him, but what is done is done. There is nothing they could do."},{"T":"301","3":"Having organized her thoughts, Rebecca almost thinks that the whole operation was set up to test and capture the Gray Raven Commandant."},{"T":"301","2":"Rebecca","3":"We were trying to track down the agent 'Luna.'"},{"T":"301","3":"Having said it out loud, a slight hint of inconsistency rings in the back of her mind."},{"T":"301","3":"She knows very well that all Collins has cared about is that agent. Everything that has driven him so far is connected to the agent."},{"T":"301","3":"The reason he has his eyes on the Gray Raven Commandant is simply that the commandant has the potential to connect to an agent without a corrupted consciousness."},{"T":"301","3":"But she suddenly realizes one thing\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"She has the priority wrong."},{"T":"301","3":"As important as that commandant is, Collins still cares about the agent more. But, right now, he is ready to move heaven and earth just to keep the commandant in his grasp..."},{"T":"301","3":"Sure, the more cards they hold in their hand, the better. But if they had to pick one over the other, they would have chosen the agent."},{"T":"301","3":"And yet, Collins is in no hurry to track down Luna, the agent, even when her M.I.N.D. activity was discovered in that town. All they did was send a squad to the surface to investigate."},{"T":"301","3":"Almost as if he cares not about finding the agent and instead the commandant's ability to 'sniff out' an agent's tracks."},{"T":"301","3":"That cannot be right\u2014the agent's whereabouts should be the most important thing, unless... Unless\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"Suddenly, Rebecca connects the dots."},{"T":"301","3":"She raises her head, frightened, and looks at the smirking Collins. His smile is still comical, but she can see the vileness behind it."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Have you figured it out, our dear socialite?"},{"T":"301","3":"She tries to speak, and that is when she discovers her throat is dry from her realization."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"I chose to tell you the truth in the past because, personally, I believed you."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Well, not that I believed you not to reveal our secrets to the Parliament. I believed that it wouldn't matter even if you did."},{"T":"301","3":"Collins repeats to her their past conversation, word-for-word."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"As for the rest, don't think about it. Just keep up your appearance and play your part as the one that dances between Kurono and the Parliament. It'll be beneficial to both of us."},{"T":"301","3":"Rebecca nods tentatively."},{"T":"301","3":"Collins sighs."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"I knew Nicky had something planned. I just wasn't expecting him to burn this bridge of ours to get what he wants."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"This makes me even more curious. Doing so means they've gotten what they wanted, something so important that they think it's okay to mess with us."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"What is it, Nicky? Does it have something to do with that intel?"},{"T":"301","3":"Collins is mumbling to himself while simultaneously looking like he is talking to Nikola across time and space."},{"T":"301","3":"Rebecca, finally having her voice back, interrupts him abruptly."},{"T":"301","2":"Rebecca","3":"Then what is your... our next move?"},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Track the transport craft. Intercept it if we can, let them go if we can't."},{"T":"301","2":"Rebecca","3":"We're just going to let them leave?"},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Say you have the key to a treasure chest but not its location, and out of nowhere, someone shows up with its location but not the key..."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Why be selfish and hold onto the key?"},{"T":"301","3":"Collins stands up and straightens the collars of his shirt, preparing to head out."},{"T":"301","3":"Before he leaves, he looks back at Rebecca."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"And when they unlock the treasure chest and bring it back, we'll just... take it. Yeah?"},{"T":"301","2":"Celica","3":"Your message is recorded. It'll be delivered alongside the supplies during the routine airdrop."},{"T":"301","2":"Celica","3":"But we don't have a forward operating base there. Dropping supplies at entirely new coordinates could catch 'some' people's attention. I've tried to conceal it with other operations as much as possible."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Thank you, Celica."},{"T":"301","3":"Instead of joking about overtime pay like she usually does, Celica just looks tired."},{"T":"301","3":"Rather, everyone in the conference room looks tired."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Go rest, Celica."},{"T":"301","3":"Celica opens her mouth, wanting to say she is fine."},{"T":"301","3":"But seeing Hassen's look, she instead says nothing, departing the room quietly, leaving Hassen and Nikola by themselves."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Transferring Cerberus has caused Murray's suspicion already. He was the one who retrieved the first part of that intel. Knowing him, he must have had a backup made. Aren't you worried that he'd give it to Kurono?"},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"He's a smart kid. He knows what's okay and what isn't."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"He won't take risks for something nonbeneficial. He's a merchant, not a dishonorable traitor."},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola frowns."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"I hope you're right."}]
