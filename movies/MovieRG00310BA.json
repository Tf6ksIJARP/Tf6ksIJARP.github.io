[{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Thinking about it, Commandant must have formed a team with Vera, Camu, and Karenina, is that right?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"I guess so, if there are only two teams. Must be very dangerous... Vera has always had her eyes on Commandant, not to mention Karenina and Camu."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"But they can't do anything in the game world, can they? At least Commandant's teammates all hate to lose."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"I think their priority is to finish the game and win over us. I just hope Commandant can get used to the situation over there."},{"T":"301","3":"After leaving the spawn point, three of them walked in the countryside. Lee and Lucia were thinking of the game's settings, while Kamui was running in front to explore the surroundings."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Lucia, Lee, I found something great."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Something great...?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Don't tell me it's some weird material again."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"No, it's a stone monument. Just come check it out!"},{"T":"301","3":"Two of them ran to Kamui and saw a old-looking stone monument."},{"T":"301","3":"It was pretty dirty, but the text on it was still barely readable."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Is this about the game world?"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Yeah, I was expecting an NPC to introduce the background settings in this kind of game, but a stone monument isn't too bad either."},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia started reading the monument."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Ever since the Goddess created this world, the war between humans and Demons had never stopped. Demons were born with great strength, so humans could only fall back into their cities."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Just when everybody thought humans would be driven to extinction, a few heroes arrived at the Land of Origin from afar."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"They were wearing exotic outfits, using strange weapons. They came with a divine revelation."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"The heroes finally helped humans to defeat the Demon King. Just when others were about to thank the heroes, they turned into light and disappeared in the sky."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Just like how they arrived."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Led by their King, the humans started to strike back at the Demons with the aim to completely eliminate them. Without the Demon King, the Demons didn't stand a chance."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"The Demons have not given up, for they still have the Goddess's artifact. It is said that the four fragments of the artifact would become one when the time comes."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"And the Demons will gain a power so great that it can help them conquer the world."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Is that all...?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"To sum it up, the humans were losing before the heroes showed up, but after they arrived, the Demons started to lose all the way."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"This is what happens when one side of the war has too much power. The humans and Demons in this world are no different. I don't like them."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Well, this kind of setting has been quite popular recently. There's no absolute right or wrong. Anyway, have you not realized the most important thing?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Are you talking about... The Goddess' artifact?"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Yeah. We don't know what the fragments actually look like, but we definitely need to collect them."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"I'm more concerned with the Goddess herself."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"We can keep an eye on them. But the top priority right now is to find Liv."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Let's continue heading toward the castle then. But there are two split roads..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"One obviously takes us to the castle. But the other one goes to a village...?"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Let's go to the village then!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Wait a sec, Kamui. Why are we going there?"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Because side quests are usually picked up from there. Sometimes, we can only find useful clues from side quests."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Trust me, I have a lot of experience."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Game experience, huh... Lucia, what do you think?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Let's do what Kamui said. If we go to the castle, we may only get the info about our main objective, but the villagers could have seen Liv."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Let's go then!"}]
