Even the tallest main city is fully submerged, save for the roof of the observatory."},{"T":"301","3":"The wind howls, and the waves rumble."},{"T":"301","3":"With one hand on her banner spear, Vera half-kneels, half-sits on the floor."},{"T":"301","3":"She was going to overpower Lamia and subdue her, whatever it took to drag her back to the control panel, so she could force her to disable the submergence command."},{"T":"301","3":"But Lamia still ran away in the end."},{"T":"301","3":"All Vera feels now is tiredness and frustration."},{"T":"301","3":"How strange she was willing to go this far, she thinks to herself. Uncharacteristically, she does not have an answer immediately. This is very unlike her\u2014she has not been this apprehensive for a long time."},{"T":"301","3":"She has protected her target and retrieved the objective. She did not need to spend the extra effort in this place, and yet."},{"T":"301","3":"What is done is done.

If you compress this period of time into 12 months, then the history of humankind begins on the last night of the year."},{"T":"301","3":"On that last night, which is 3.5 million years ago, the first hominin stood up, and instead of looking at the earth, it looked to the stars."},{"T":"301","3":"It takes 60 seconds from humans understanding seasons by observing the stars to the first astronaut planting his flag on the moon."},{"T":"301","3":"And humankind's current obstacle, the Punishing Virus, is but a blip in the grand scheme of things."},{"T":"301","3":"Showered in sunlight, Vera walks up, her eyes opened wide, looking directly at the sun."},{"T":"301","3":"She can almost see the woman's figure against the glare of the sun.

What role does it play in this order?"},{"T":"304","1":"As far as we can tell, the zero-point energy is a crucial condition for the Punishing Virus' existence."},{"T":"304","1":"But, personally, I prefer the theory that zero-point energy opened a pathway instead of creating the virus."},{"T":"304","1":"The zero-point reactor is a product of extremely complicated, advanced physics and mathematics."},{"T":"304","1":"On the other hand, the more advanced the technology is, the more susceptible it is to the Punishing Virus."},{"T":"304","1":"That is to say, a primitive civilization wouldn't have a chance to encounter it."},{"T":"304","1":"The Punishing Virus wouldn't have crawled out of a furnace or a steam engine."},{"T":"304","1":"Even if they did encounter it, as long as there was no electricity or digital devices, the Punishing Virus wouldn't have made a dent."},{"T":"304","1":"The logical conclusion is obvious: the Punishing Virus targets highly advanced civilizations."},{"T":"304","1":"It grows in a civilization like a parasite to keep it in check. And if the civilization is too sick to heal, it dies."},{"T":"304","1":"That's right, an old cliche\u2014the great filter of civilizations."},{"T":"304","1":"I don't have any proof, obviously. I haven't observed any other civilizations that were hit by the Punishing Virus. Our only sample is humankind."},{"T":"304","1":"But maybe you'll have the chance to go further.
