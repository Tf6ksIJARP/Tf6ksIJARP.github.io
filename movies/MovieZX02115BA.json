[{"T":"301","3":"After that first and last meeting\u2014"},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"I thought there would be more opposition."},{"T":"301","3":"Lustrous looks slightly surprised."},{"T":"301","3":"The administrative director closes the metallic clasp of the suitcase and smiles at the research director."},{"T":"301","2":"Admin Director","3":"My hands would be on your neck if I was still the same person from when I first came here."},{"T":"301","2":"Admin Director","3":"Remember the first night you became the director? I dragged you out from your lab and hosted a dinner with the other directors."},{"T":"301","2":"Admin Director","3":"I asked you what you think of the base when we were eating. You said this place is like a brain constantly metabolizing."},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"I did say that."},{"T":"301","2":"Admin Director","3":"It was a good metaphor."},{"T":"301","2":"Admin Director","3":"Does it matter what carbon dioxide and the sodium think when they're created from metabolism?"},{"T":"301","3":"Lustrous does not hesitate."},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"Not at all. The only thing that matters is the thought."},{"T":"301","2":"Admin Director","3":"That's why the nutrients go to your part of the brain. Do what you have to do."},{"T":"301","3":"The administrative director nods at the others around the table."},{"T":"301","2":"Data Director","3":"Don't worry. We'll do our job."},{"T":"301","3":"Lustrous looks at the directors one by one."},{"T":"301","3":"She lets out a barely visible smile."},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"I'm glad to have you as my colleagues. It's an honor working with you all."},{"T":"301","2":"Admin Director","3":"The honor is mine. I look forward to Atlantis leading the next Industrial Revolution, but if I won't live long enough for that day to come, I'll die where it sits."},{"T":"301","3":"She stands."},{"T":"301","2":"Admin Director","3":"I'll 'go' first. Try to stay away as long as you can."},{"T":"301","2":"Admin Director","3":"We are sorry that you have to be the one who carries it all at the end."},{"T":"301","3":"Lustrous stands in front of the window of the observatory, looking out at the lifeless seaborne city."},{"T":"301","3":"The more one thing has shone, the more forsaken it looks when it falls."},{"T":"301","3":"Too long has passed. Everyone she knows has passed. Now, standing here alone, she looks like a wavering torch in a storm."},{"T":"301","3":"And this last torch is about to go out."},{"T":"301","3":"The weather is not great today. Dark clouds cover the sky, but the rain has yet to fall. Literal silver linings are peeking from between the clouds."},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"She closes her eyes, trying to feel the warmth on her cheeks."},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"So in the end, I still have that speck of weakness in me..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"Oh, brain, I despise you sometimes."},{"T":"301","3":"Lustrous sighs softly."},{"T":"301","3":"She has never shown any weakness in front of others because she was their flag."},{"T":"301","3":"A flag is a symbol and a metaphor. A flag does not need to show humanity or have a heart. A flag just needs to be hung before an army during wars and planted on the enemy's castle after victory."},{"T":"301","3":"As long as the flag does not fall, everyone else will charge toward the same destination. As long as it stands, everyone will march forward fearlessly for their dreams and beliefs."},{"T":"301","3":"But now, everyone she was leading is gone. They have burnt their dignity and soul into cinders for their last act for humanity."},{"T":"301","3":"And so, the flag becomes a human again."},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"Try to stay away as long as I can...?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"I'm afraid I can't keep that promise."},{"T":"301","3":"The observatory used to be where they liked to stay the most."},{"T":"301","3":"It sits at the top of Atlantis, and they could see the whole city from here. They could see the ocean, the sky, the stars."},{"T":"301","3":"The observatory is empty now. She is the only one left, trying to see humanity's future."},{"T":"301","3":"Lustrous walks to her chair and sits down."},{"T":"301","3":"She has done her job. This is as far as she goes."},{"T":"301","3":"She is tired."},{"T":"301","3":"She will leave the rest of the work to those who come after."},{"T":"301","3":"Lustrous turns around and takes one last look at the setting sun."},{"T":"301","3":"Just one regret\u2014she thinks."},{"T":"301","3":"The day she set foot on this island, she thought she would go to the edge of the universe one day."},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"Who would have thought that, in the end, I'd go gentle into that good night?"},{"T":"301","3":"Her last whisper is carried away by the wind, disappearing with the last hint of sunlight."},{"T":"301","3":"The moment you open the door to the observatory, you feel like you have just pressed the play button on a snapshot of the past."},{"T":"301","3":"As the sea breeze rushes in, the room begins to fog up."},{"T":"301","3":"The woman you have seen in the videos is sitting quietly on a chair not far from you."},{"T":"301","3":"Her body does not look rotten. It has dried thoroughly under the same clothes you have seen in the records, easily identifiable."},{"T":"301","3":"A heavy sense of sadness suddenly brews and fills the room."},{"T":"301","3":"Silently, Vera walks toward the woman and kneels down on one knee."},{"T":"301","3":"And then she discovers something."},{"T":"301","3":"The supply crate next to the body is filled with food."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"Vera's eyes widen."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Haha\u2014hahaha\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"For a moment there, she can even picture the woman's last moment from what has been left behind in the room."},{"T":"301","3":"Unlike the others, Lustrous was not starved to death. She chose to end her life."},{"T":"301","3":"Realizing that, Vera laughs hysterically as if to cover another feeling deep inside."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"This is 'as far as she goes'... Then what the hell is this?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"You tricky bastard. In the end, you couldn't take it."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Well, then. I'll seize it from you\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"Vera opens a pack of hardtacks and stuffs them in her mouth."},{"T":"301","3":"Constructs do not need to eat. What she is doing is technically pointless."},{"T":"301","3":"But Vera just starts stuffing the hardtacks into her mouth one after another like a ritual where she is picking up the baton."},{"T":"301","3":"A flag being passed from Lustrous to Vera."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"If you can't take it..."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"I will."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"I will take your dreams, your future, your desires to live, your lost pain... I will take it all."},{"T":"301","3":"She stands up, reaches inside Lustrous' coat, and takes out their 'legacy.'"},{"T":"301","3":"She gives it to you."},{"T":"302","2":"Vera...","4":"I'll keep it safe."},{"T":"301","3":"She nods."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Stay here. I'm going spearfishing."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Who knows how many things here are of use?
