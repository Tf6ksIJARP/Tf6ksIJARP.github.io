M.I.N.D. container pressure... within acceptable limits. Routine Checklist... complete."},{"T":"301","3":"The sleeping pod begins the air exchange necessary to open the hatch. The inert gas that serves as a barrier is sucked out through the vents of the air conditioning system."},{"T":"301","3":"Woosh\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"The fresh air from outside instantaneously replaces the industrial-smelling inert gas.

I'll leave things here to you."},{"T":"301","3":"Asimov is not at all worried that the nine-year-old girl who stands before him will mess things up.
