Colors seem to mix together, and the air is stagnant with the smell of vital fluid and a certain metallic tang. You see nothing but whiteness."},{"T":"302","2":"What is happening?"},{"T":"301","3":"A sudden voice, misty and dreamlike, seeps over from afar."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"...Commandant..."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"...Link... Stabilizer..."},{"T":"302","2":"Huh?"},{"T":"301","3":"You try to ask the voice, but nothing comes out of your mouth.

A metallic floor then follows. The sight is both a familiar, and foreign one."},{"T":"302","2":"This is..."},{"T":"302","2":"The underground cave in City 075.","4":"This must be a dream."},{"T":"301","3":"Indeed. This place looks the same as the secret base of the Ascendants, or at least, as you remember it. But then, why would you be here?"},{"T":"302","2":"Ugh..."},{"T":"301","3":"A sudden headache bites away at you, disturbing your thoughts."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Urgh\u2014!"},{"T":"302","2":"The Corrupted?"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Urgh!!!"},{"T":"302","2":"This looks bad..."},{"T":"301","3":"Yep.

No chance."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"\u2014!!"},{"T":"301","3":"The Corrupted approach in a most inhuman fashion, their appendages even flicking gravel up at you.

She draws her weapon and mechanically trudges forward. The Corrupted behind her also seem to have multiplied in numbers like magic."},{"T":"302","2":"Where did they come from...?","4":"This makes no sense at all..."},{"T":"301","3":"Right as Alpha raises her blade, the answer to this series of strange events finally strikes you."},{"T":"302","2":"This isn't the real world!"},{"T":"301","2":"\u03b1?","3":"..."},{"T":"302","2":"Ngh!"},{"T":"301","3":"You take a step back, barely dodging the attack. The wind from the cut still scratches you like a whip."},{"T":"302","2":"Sure hurts like reality, though..."},{"T":"301","2":"\u03b1?","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"The Alpha-looking someone is not over yet. She attacks you once more."},{"T":"302","2":"If only I had a weapon...","4":"I can't handle her head on."},{"T":"301","3":"Dodging the attack, you scan around for a makeshift weapon."},{"T":"301","3":"Dodging the attack, you scan around for a quick route of escape."},{"T":"301","3":"...And you discover a white figure about ten meters away from you, just around a corner."},{"T":"302","2":"That's...","4":"Luna?"},{"T":"301","2":"\u03b1?","3":"...?"},{"T":"301","3":"Hearing what you just said, 'Alpha' finally gives a reaction.

She simply ignores you and sheathes her blade, slowly approaching Luna."},{"T":"301","3":"The Corrupted nearby, as if following the same command, also move toward Luna. Their eyes glow in a sanguine redness, brighter than before."},{"T":"302","2":"This isn't right..."},{"T":"302","2":"They seem to be..."},{"T":"301","3":"The Luna hiding in the corner shuffles.

She then pivots and bolts into the darkness, her tiny frame quickly dissolving into nothing."},{"T":"302","2":"They're attacking Luna?"},{"T":"301","3":"At the very least, 'Alpha' and the Corrupted are still going after her. You should be safe, for now."},{"T":"301","3":"You slowly jog to a halt as you reach a hiding place and finally catch a breath.

The real Alpha would never do that to her sister... So this 'Alpha' must not be the real one."},{"T":"301","3":"'Alpha' was brimming with hostility for her sister. And Luna herself seems to be targeted by the Corrupted as well..."},{"T":"301","3":"Based on all that has happened, plus the fact that this cannot be the real world, this leaves only one option..."},{"T":"302","2":"This is a M.I.N.D."},{"T":"301","3":"This is the only plausible explanation."},{"T":"301","3":"Since M.I.N.D.s are highly incompatible with other consciousnesses, some M.I.N.D.s would activate a self-defense mechanism during a mind link and attack any consciousnesses within... Or so you have heard from Asimov."},{"T":"302","2":"If it's Luna, then this is possible.","4":"Asimov must be happy with a new case study."},{"T":"301","3":"Surveying your surroundings once more, you find it to be deathly quiet.

They crumble as quickly as they appear."},{"T":"301","3":"Hearing the mechanical thumps from behind and around her, she becomes disoriented, more and more."},{"T":"301","3":"Run... Dead end... Turn... Dead end... Turn again... Another dead end\u2014the paths all begin to blur together."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Ah... Hah..."},{"T":"301","3":"The sounds behind her too, begin to merge into clear footsteps, edging ever closer."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"Angst\u2014how foreign this feeling must be to her.

Her fearful look melts into a daze. She stands there, petrified like a rock."},{"T":"302","2":"That was just a basic non-combat mechanoid.","4":"What's with the look on your face...?"},{"T":"301","3":"This is just downright uncanny."},{"T":"301","3":"The leader of the Ascendants, a most fearsome enemy, now standing dumbfounded before you like some innocent little girl.

Before you could even react, the world before you spins around like a whirlpool."},{"T":"301","3":"The ground curls up like a canvas, and Luna lets out a small yelp of surprise. Like a leaf, she is almost instantaneously drawn into the center of the whirlpool, disappearing into the warped space."}]
