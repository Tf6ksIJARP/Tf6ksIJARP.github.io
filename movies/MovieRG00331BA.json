He repeated it once again when we arrived, just like a normal NPC."},{"T":"301","3":"In front of us was a huge, empty space. The strange-looking building in the center was probably the hidden Demon King's Castle."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Finally, you're here... I've been waiting for you."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Commandant! Everybody!"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Don't move. I won't let you interfere with the plan."},{"T":"301","3":"Vera and Camu were standing next to the King, along with Liv, who had a mysterious black circle around her wrists."},{"T":"301","3":"From what Camu said, that circle was probably a shackle."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"What are you doing there, Camu? Come down and face me!"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"What a fool..."},{"T":"301","3":"Kamui immediately walked up after seeing Camu and started taunting, but the latter only shook his head with disdain."},{"T":"301","3":"Lee stopped Kamui as the King slowly walked forward."},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"I'm going to repeat this, heroes. I don't want to, and I won't hurt you."},{"T":"301","2":"Demon King","3":"But you want to destroy this world, don't you?"},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"Oh, Demon King... I didn't know you would become such a freak. If only I could have found out earlier, you wouldn't be able to meet the heroes."},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"Even without me, others will still stand up against you once they find out about your plan..."},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"But nobody will know. In this endless cycle with the name of game, only two of us have realized the truth of the world."},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"Oh, and these heroes, of course."},{"T":"302","2":"Are you really going to destroy the world?","4":"But we want to protect the world."},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"It's true. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate living in the game world as a game character, because that's just my destiny."},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"To protect this world... That sounds like something heroes will say, \u3010kuroname\u3011."},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"But I don't want to accept the rules of this world. I will no longer be a puppet of the system, repeating the meaningless dialogues again and again!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"I see. You don't want to be limited, and want to become a real, independent AI. Is that right?"},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"Correct. The Goddess' artifact will grant me this power to reach beyond this game world!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"How is that even possible? Do you really think an object within the game can have any impact on the bottom layer code?"},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"Of course it can. That's exactly what the Goddess did."},{"T":"302","2":"Is the Goddess real?","4":"Are you kidding?"},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"Of course. That's how this world runs!"},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"Whatever you think. In the end, I'm the only one who really knows what to do!"},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"I will destroy this world with my new power, and create it again based on my own rules. I will become the new Goddess and break away from the system!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Hmm... I get what you are saying, but I just found a problem."},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"A problem...?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"A man can't become a Goddess."},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Hah..."},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"Go get them!
