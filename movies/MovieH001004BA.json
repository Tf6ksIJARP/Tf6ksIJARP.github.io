Staying here only to watch strangers die here on this island... You can only delay the inevitable. Nothing will change."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"Of course, I also thought about letting my companions return to the sealed underground facility while I go out and search for hope."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"But as a corrupted machine, where else can I go besides here?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"The world is not so optimistic, but it's not as hopeless as you think."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"Of course, humans are more willing to accept Constructs that share their resemblance."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...Do you really think it's that idealistic?"},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"...?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"After I became a Construct, those people... They looked at me with disdain and fear."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"I heard them complain about having to spend more resources and cut down on other expenses in order to maintain the Construct army."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"We fight to give hope to others, yet some people insist on staying in Babylonia is enough to prolong life. They say there's no need to take back Earth."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Even some 'prophets' claim that Construct tech will lead to the downfall of humanity just because we can't pass our genes on to further generations."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Not to mention, people fear Constructs as a threat due to their single combat ability. Others feel it's unfair for Constructs to get a free pass to Babylonia."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"And the small number of defectors only serve to prove that their prejudices and fear aren't just fabricated out of thin air."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"That being said, there's an increasing number of people like Commandant who put trust and hope in their comrades. So we can't stop moving forward."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"Trust in their comrades?"},{"T":"301","3":"She sneers."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"I lost any semblance of 'trust' when Master died."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"I chose this path.

You long betrayed this trust!"},{"T":"302","2":"(Open fire)","4":"She's lived up to my trust."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"What?!"},{"T":"301","3":"A barrage of bullets accurately penetrates the defense barrier around the Witch of the Sea's core."},{"T":"301","3":"She looks in horror at the prince's dress on you, which is stained red but undamaged, and collapses on the beach."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"You were hiding nearby..."},{"T":"302","2":"I just got here."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"How are you still alive? The attendant watched you die... It recorded everything..."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"Hmph... It was all just an act?"},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"Even with a sword pointed at you, unable to speak... you still played along seamlessly?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...You..."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"So... This is what trust really is."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"If I had trusted him... a little more... Would I..."},{"T":"301","2":"??","3":"Tsk... Looks like I'm late."},{"T":"301","3":"Looking in the direction of the voice, you see a young man smirking nearby."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"...Roland..."},{"T":"301","3":"She stretches out her trembling hand as if pleading for help."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"We meet again, Gray Raven."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...!"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Are you here all alone?

The attendant watched you die... It recorded everything..."},{"T":"302","2":"Lucia didn't hurt me at all."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"Someone as powerful as her turns their blade against you, and you trust her?

Trust..."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"Is this your... trust? Your... bond?"},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"The Witch of the Sea looks deep into the island as if recalling her past."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"If I had been able to..."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"...No. I have no way of knowing if he wanted to protect me\u2014or destroy me."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"It's not too late.

But right as a glimmer of hope appears on her face, several shots come from behind..."},{"T":"301","2":"Witch of the Sea","3":"...!"},{"T":"301","3":"A barrage of bullets accurately penetrates the defense barrier around the Witch of the Sea's core. Before she can even say a word, she collapses onto the beach and loses control over her frame."},{"T":"301","2":"??","3":"Tsk...
