[{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"So what's with this urgent 'assignment'? Why did you summon me here halfway through my mission? That could catch unnecessary attention."},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola does not answer her question. Instead, he seems to be lost in thought, hesitating\u2014a rare sight for Vera."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"If you have nothing else to say, I'm going back. I hate wasting time..."},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola raises his head and looks into Vera's eyes. He slowly opens his mouth."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"I want you to eliminate a Construct. A deserter who ran from the battle."},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola sends the mission details to Vera's terminal. Such missions are usually the jobs of the Purifying Force, but Nikola would also assign certain special ones to Vera directly."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"What is this frame...?"},{"T":"301","3":"Vera notices the information about an all-new frame in the files. Nikola nods and casts it to the holographic display."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"It's your new frame, secretly designed for anti-Construct combat, with its power and armor significantly boosted. It hasn't officially entered service in Babylonia records, so... keep it off the books. Have I made myself clear?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Designed for anti-Construct combat... A filthy 'executioner' that specializes in taking the lives of their peers. It does suit me well, but..."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Why is there a need to use an unofficial frame with such urgency? Stop bluffing and tell me, who is this target?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"To kill a hero that has gone out of control... Only a filthy executioner like you can do such a job."},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola stares into Vera's eyes for a long time before finally saying the name of the target."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"The mission target is... 'Lloyd'."},{"T":"301","3":"The transport craft hovers over a flower field. Petals are swept into the air, then fall to the ground like raindrops."},{"T":"301","3":"As the aircraft descends, a Construct with long, crimson hair jumps to the ground, sending up another rain of flowers."},{"T":"301","3":"Not far away is her mission target. Lloyd has been waiting for a while."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"I knew it would be you... Miss Vera."},{"T":"301","3":"Seeing Vera, Lloyd makes the same smile that he always carries, despite his visibly severe Punishing Virus infection. No one would be surprised if he turned into a Corrupted in the next minute."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"Is this your new frame...? It looks quite similar to the previous one, but it gives me a completely different feeling."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"This new frame is designed for killing Constructs... and I'm here for you."},{"T":"301","3":"Vera speaks apathetically without her usual grin."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"Yeah... I know..."},{"T":"301","3":"Lloyd's calm response makes Vera feel annoyed for no reason."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Why? Why are you not running away...?"},{"T":"301","3":"According to Nikola, Lloyd was leading a squad of Construct soldiers in a regular mission, but they were surrounded by Corrupted. Lloyd fled, leaving all other soldiers behind."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"What the heck did you run into...?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"It was just one Corrupted... But it alone had brought despair to all of us."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"You probably won't believe me, but that Corrupted had its own consciousness, along with superior strength. It called itself 'Gabriel', and it even had the ability to command other Corrupted."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"But it wasn't after those soldiers... Its target had always been me."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"A Corrupted with its own consciousness..."},{"T":"301","3":"When Vera was still working for Kurono, she once heard about the special Corrupted\u2014the Ascendants."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"No matter how hard we fought, we could just barely hold off the attacks from Gabriel and the countless Corrupted."},{"T":"301","3":"Lloyd finally managed to break through the siege alone, but it was all part of its plan."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"I'd like to propose a deal. As a Construct, you have 'qualified' to become one of us. I can spare the lives of those soldiers if you accept the test of the Ascension-Network."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"Do you want me to believe a Corrupted? I'm not crazy."},{"T":"301","3":"Gabriel shakes its head and closes the book in its hand."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Unlike you humans, I do not lie, especially when I'm facing a weak foe."},{"T":"301","3":"Gabriel raises its hand, and the Corrupted surrounding the soldiers far away immediately stop attacking, only keeping a loose circle around them."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"And... you don't have a choice either."},{"T":"301","3":"As Gabriel speaks, it reaches out a bony left hand toward Lloyd. Inside its palm, blood-red virus begins to form..."},{"T":"301","3":"As Lloyd's infection level rapidly goes up, his mind is devoured by an excruciating agony."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"Ugh...!"},{"T":"301","3":"Even so, Lloyd manages to stab Gabriel's arm with the banner spear. He quickly leaps back and jumps into the forest underneath the cliff."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"I didn't see that coming... but it doesn't matter. My job is done. The Ascension-Network will do its job now."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"I couldn't do anything except run... The Punishing Virus infection hurts more than any wound."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"But why do I still want to stay alive? No matter how awful I get, I don't want to die..."},{"T":"301","3":"Lloyd's right hand keeps trembling from the infection, hardly holding on to his banner spear. He strips his uniform apart and ties it up."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"How terribly clumsy of me... I'm so weak and timid, but still want to fight to live until the last moment."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"There's nothing shameful about fighting to live... You didn't do anything wrong, but I'm still going to take your life."},{"T":"301","3":"Vera gazes at Lloyd as she unsheathes the katana. The next moment, it clashes with the head of his banner spear\u2014and she finally smiles again."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Come, show me how much you have grown!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"Miss Vera!"},{"T":"301","3":"Lloyd roars and strikes at Vera's leg, but she steps on the spear, pressing it down with her entire body. He is unable to pull it out."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Die!"},{"T":"301","3":"Lloyd hesitates for one instant, and Vera's blade almost lands on his head."},{"T":"301","3":"Lloyd splits the spear in half and blocks Vera's blade with the section that is not held down before launching a kick at Vera's abdomen. Vera pulls the katana back and blocks it, but she is still pushed back quite a few steps."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"You have been training hard over the last month..."},{"T":"301","3":"Lloyd has been asking Vera for advice ever since he requested her to train him. He managed to endure all the practices she gave him, no matter how unreasonable they were."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"If I was using the old Support frame... I might actually be overpowered by you."},{"T":"301","3":"Vera is using a standard katana to avoid exposing her identity. It has cracked from the kick, but Lloyd has also lost half of his weapon."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"Hmm... like you said, I was working hard..."},{"T":"301","3":"The increasing level of infection makes Lloyd gasp for air as he holds himself up with the banner spear. They are both well aware that the next attack will determine their fate."},{"T":"301","3":"They tacitly charge toward each other, and come to a complete stop in the rain of falling flowers."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"That's good. Thank you..."},{"T":"301","3":"Vera's katana pierces through Lloyd's chest. It serves its final duty and breaks in half. Lloyd falls to the ground."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"Miss Vera... I fought until the end this time, didn't I?"},{"T":"301","3":"Vera smiles and drops to one knee next to Lloyd, gently lifting his head up with her hands."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Yes..."},{"T":"301","3":"Lloyd lets out a satisfying smile. He takes out the notebook from his pocket."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"Miss Vera, there's a secret that I want to tell you..."},{"T":"301","3":"Vera nods again, quietly staring at the sunset across the horizon."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Yes..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"I have been secretly writing down the stories of every past 'Lloyd' into scripts and sending them to the WGAA theater."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"The truth about 'Lloyd' cannot be revealed to the public, but I hope perhaps one day people will remember our stories through these plays."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Is that so..."},{"T":"301","3":"Lloyd chuckles with slight embarrassment."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"Compared with fighting, maybe I'm better at writing stories. But I never regret becoming 'Lloyd' and carrying the destiny of hero upon my shoulders..."},{"T":"301","3":"Lloyd looks at his right arm. It is completely out of his control, and it keeps twisting into terrible shapes."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"Too bad I still failed... I didn't become a hero. I didn't become the final hope."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"What nonsense are you talking? You saved those Constructs and bought them time. You did everything you could."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"I hope so... Do you think my story deserves to be written down in this notebook?"},{"T":"301","3":"Lloyd's eyes begin to lose their luster. The energy inside him finally runs out as his vital fluid pours out from the piercing wound."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"But my story is still missing an ending."},{"T":"301","3":"Lloyd hands his banner spear to Vera, who has lost her weapon."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"'Lloyd the Undying Hero defeated the mighty enemy and saved all his comrades. Not even one life was lost.'"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"What a cliche, unrealistic ending..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"But I believe in you, Miss Vera. You can save everybody and lead us to victory."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Why do you think I will do these things that won't benefit me at all...?"},{"T":"301","3":"...She hears no reply."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Every single one of you is like this, putting expectations on me without asking first."},{"T":"301","3":"...She hears no reply."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"I'll take the spear. It's a better fit for this frame."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"But since I have accidentally taken your deposit, I will make sure to get the job done. You can rest."},{"T":"301","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"The aircraft takes off once again, blowing flower petals into the sky. They fall onto Lloyd, as well as the new page on the opened notebook."}]
