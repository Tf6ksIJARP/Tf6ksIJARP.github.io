That's right where the error was."},{"T":"301","2":"Stern Male Construct","3":"That's right."},{"T":"301","3":"After finishing his line this time, the door swings open, and a small girl runs in from outside."},{"T":"301","3":"A mechanical block floats around her, resembling an auxiliary device unique to her."},{"T":"301","2":"Rowler","3":"Coco's back. Let's get ready to go."},{"T":"301","2":"Coco","3":"Listen! I made a big discovery!"},{"T":"301","2":"The Dead Commandant","3":"What is it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Coco","3":"I've discovered that the red tide retains the consciousness of the dead and can speak!"},{"T":"301","2":"The Dead Commandant","3":"What?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Coco","3":"I found the missing commandant in the red flood!"},{"T":"301","3":"The four of you, as well as the three projections, all look surprised."},{"T":"301","2":"Coco","3":"She kept calling my name and asking if I had seen her sister..."},{"T":"301","2":"The Dead Commandant","3":"That doesn't make any sense! What do you think it is? The River Styx of Hades?"},{"T":"301","2":"Rowler","3":"Bahahaha, I didn't think you were gone all this time because you were out daydreaming!"},{"T":"301","3":"Their tease causes Coco to tremble slightly with anger. She stops smiling and bites her lip. The commandant realizes their rude behavior and sighs, motioning Coco to continue."},{"T":"301","2":"Coco","3":"Not only did I find out about the missing commandant... I uncovered two other commonalities after I went asking around the other scavengers."},{"T":"301","3":"Coco maintains her polite smile, but her voice has a solemn undertone."},{"T":"301","2":"Coco","3":"First off, the voices they've heard also come from those who died in the red tide, which is different from the River Styx. It's not like you can hear everyone who has ever died..."},{"T":"301","3":"The commandant nods. She relaxes a bit, then swipes the screen with her fingertip to show a video to the other three."},{"T":"301","2":"Coco","3":"I'm not sure if the red liquid has to be the direct cause of death, or if it applies to all those that get swallowed up after death."},{"T":"301","2":"Coco","3":"I didn't see how the commandant died. I just found some of the things she left behind near the tide."},{"T":"301","2":"Coco","3":"Even though I could hear her, I could only distinguish a few vague sentences. It's impossible to judge whether the red liquid retains her consciousness or is just imitating her."},{"T":"301","2":"Coco","3":"The second thing is, the scavengers said they could hear her voice too."},{"T":"301","2":"The Dead Commandant","3":"In other words, this is a phenomenon that anyone can observe. It's not like other paranormal folklore..."},{"T":"301","2":"Coco","3":"But her voice only appeared when I got close to the tide. Kind of like how no one would greet a stranger in a distant crowd."},{"T":"301","2":"Rowler","3":"Whaddaya mean? I would if they're good lookin'!"},{"T":"301","2":"Stern Male Construct","3":"Well then, let it kill you so we can see for ourselves."},{"T":"301","3":"Hearing this, Rowler drops his smile and looks down at the ground.

That's definitely his voice."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"How can this be? Did he end up... dying in the Red Tide?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Based on the clues we just obtained, I'd be willing to bet."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"With the Red Tide as big as it is now, there's sure to be a lot more remains in it."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"But why were there so many people and Corrupted stationed in this area?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Maybe they weren't stationed here but gathered here."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Gathered here? You mean the Red Tide lured them here?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"...Lured, like... the Pied Piper?"},{"T":"302","2":"Pied Piper?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Yeah, it's nothing. Just an old children's story."},{"T":"302","2":"What's it about?"},{"T":"301","3":"Just as Liv is about to explain, the four of you hear the sound of a door collapsing."},{"T":"301","3":"A new projection emerges from the darkness. Somehow, her figure is blurry, but you can still clearly see her mermaid tail."},{"T":"302","2":"...Lamia."},{"T":"301","2":"Stern Male Construct","3":"Corrupted?! Kill her!"},{"T":"301","3":"However, the Constructs stand little chance against an Ascendant. The Construct in front is thrown across the room, and he stops moving after barely any struggle."},{"T":"301","2":"The Dead Commandant","3":"Coco! RUN! Our mission is to report back!"},{"T":"301","3":"Just as the commandant gives the order, the Ascendant throws the human against the ceiling, and the commandant's neck snaps from the impact, quietly falling to the other side of the room."},{"T":"301","3":"The remaining two Constructs cry out. Without hesitation, they follow their commandant's last order and charge out the room in opposite directions."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"...Why do you have to run away in different directions? Can't you make my pursuit easier..."},{"T":"301","3":"She looks at each of them, then turns to pursue Rowler."},{"T":"301","3":"The projection follows as Coco runs downstairs with her floating auxiliary device before hearing Rowler screaming nearby."},{"T":"301","2":"Coco","3":"Dammit, we don't stand a chance against this enemy!"},{"T":"301","2":"Coco","3":"I must... I must..."},{"T":"301","3":"Coco grabs her auxiliary device and stuffs it into a secret compartment in the corridor. She removes the keycard, then destroys the furniture in the corridor with her weapon in an attempt to delay the Ascendant."},{"T":"301","3":"Right as she stuffs the auxiliary device into the secret compartment, the projection disappears. Unable to see what happens next, you can only hear the recorded dialog from the two of them."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"Missing something?"},{"T":"301","2":"Coco","3":"How did you come out of... Wait, how can a Corrupted like you talk?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"...Do I really have to explain everything?"},{"T":"301","2":"Coco","3":"Who the hell are you?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"That doesn't concern you. Since you were investigating under the Ascendants' watchful eyes, you can't walk out of here alive."},{"T":"301","2":"Coco","3":"What's an Ascendant? What do you mean by their watchful eyes? Did you create the tide?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"Quit asking so many questions. I can't answer them all at once."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"But one thing is certain. This is providence. So, the world cannot find out yet."},{"T":"301","3":"With that, you hear the sound of an explosion. Coco screams as the stairs collapse."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"I accidentally said too much, but it doesn't matter. She's already dead."},{"T":"301","3":"Lamia sighs and jumps down from the second floor, her scowling fading into the distance."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"How troublesome. Now I have to chase the other guy who ran away, but I'm sure he hasn't gotten far with that injury."},{"T":"302","2":"Did she say 'under their watchful eyes'?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"If Huaxu is here, I wouldn't be surprised if the Ascendant base is nearby."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"That may have been why Huaxu was brought here in the first place."},{"T":"302","2":"Do you really think they're working together?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...What are you saying, Commandant?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"You mean, Huaxu intentionally leaked the Ascendants' location?"},{"T":"302","2":"It's possible."},{"T":"301","3":"At that moment, your comms indicator flashes."},{"T":"301","2":"Bridget","3":"Hey, looks like we've finally reached you."},{"T":"302","2":"Is something wrong?"},{"T":"301","2":"Bridget","3":"We lost contact for so long, I was starting to get worried."},{"T":"301","2":"Bridget","3":"Not to mention, we detected a large red mass heading straight for you."},{"T":"301","2":"Bridget","3":"We thought we were going to lose you too. I've been worried sick!"},{"T":"302","2":"Lose us 'too'?"},{"T":"301","2":"Bridget","3":"Yeah. We've already lost contact with a lot of teams due to the poor signal, or because of that red liquid."},{"T":"301","2":"Bridget","3":"Can you tell me what's going on?"},{"T":"301","2":"Bridget","3":"That way I can tell the other teams to stay clear."},{"T":"301","2":"Bridget","3":"The Red Tide, eh?"},{"T":"301","2":"Bridget","3":"It's just like you said. Huaxu most likely let Gestalt discover these coordinates."},{"T":"301","2":"Bridget","3":"Since the Ascendants want to use the Red Tide, their base must be nearby. We need to give this target higher priority!"},{"T":"301","2":"Bridget","3":"What's wrong? Worried that changing your objective will cause issues?"},{"T":"302","2":"No. I also think tracking them should be our priority."},{"T":"301","2":"Bridget","3":"Agreed. I'll report the new target to the higher-ups. Hopefully, they'll dispatch more people."},{"T":"301","2":"Bridget","3":"But, as you know, with the signal as bad as it is here, it's probably going to be sunset when we hear back."},{"T":"301","2":"Bridget","3":"Continue with your mission! Based on what the others have said, Huaxu is most likely at the Ascendants' base."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Indeed."},{"T":"301","2":"Bridget","3":"Do you need help leaving where you are before you continue your investigation?"},{"T":"302","2":"That would be great."},{"T":"301","2":"Bridget","3":"Alright, I'll dispatch a ship to get you. Wait by the hotel window, like Cinderella's carriage waiting for her at midnight!"},{"T":"302","2":"What's the situation with Babylonia?"},{"T":"301","2":"Bridget","3":"We haven't received any good news. But, at least we haven't heard anything worse."},{"T":"301","2":"Bridget","3":"Seems like it's still roughly at the same altitude as when you first left. It's rising slowly, but it can't accelerate for a while. Which means that it's still in danger of being targeted from the surface."},{"T":"302","2":"How about the others?"},{"T":"301","2":"Bridget","3":"As you know, most of the crew has descended along with you. Those that remained onboard are scrambling to clean up."},{"T":"301","2":"Bridget","3":"Regardless, this has been a slap in the face for some people."},{"T":"302","2":"Some people?"},{"T":"301","2":"Bridget","3":"Those who got a little too complacent hiding in Babylonia."},{"T":"301","2":"Bridget","3":"As long as matters on Earth aren't resolved, I won't be surprised if this happens again. And no one can guarantee that we will be so successful next time."},{"T":"301","2":"Bridget","3":"Well, we'll leave what's up there to the higher-ups. We've got more pressing matters here."},{"T":"301","2":"Bridget","3":"If we don't solve the problem here, Babylonia will still be in danger."},{"T":"302","2":"On it."},{"T":"301","3":"Bridget smiles brightly, waves, and terminates the call."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"...Guess we need to get to work."}]
