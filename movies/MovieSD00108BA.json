Maybe she just wants to watch the fireworks."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Maybe. The firework show is about to begin. Can't believe I'm saying it, but I'm a little excited."},{"T":"302","2":"Let's go watch!"},{"T":"301","3":"With the faint retreat of the wind, the dazzling light shines like the morning star and rushes straight into the sky."},{"T":"301","3":"With a loud bang, it slowly blooms at the edge of the cloud line, marking smooth streaks in the sky."},{"T":"301","3":"The steaks blend with each other, and then gradually separate. For a time, the night sky becomes a sea of colorful flowers."},{"T":"301","3":"This is the performance brought by Karenina's gunfire."},{"T":"301","3":"The beauty at this moment is deeply imprinted in the hearts of everyone present."},{"T":"301","3":"This is their most precious memory and will guide them forward together."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"So, are these... Christmas fireworks?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"They're gorgeous... I'm getting goosebumps!"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Me to... It's completely different from the fireworks I remember."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"What do you remember, Liv?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Um... It was gorgeous and spectacular, too. But it felt cold and emotionless\u2014just explosions in the sky. One after another..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"At that time, I just stayed at home and watched my brothers and sisters set off fireworks. I imagined what it would be like if I lit fireworks by myself."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"The color, shape and bang of fireworks..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"So many, many feelings to be conveyed, but no one wanted to..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"But now, I feel warm and excited... (Tears up) I don't know how to describe it. When I saw the fireworks spreading across the sky just now, I suddenly felt... so happy."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"That's what it's like to be with your so-called 'family.' I think I'm starting to understand this, too."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"The reason why so many humans cherished Christmas in the past is precisely because they felt connected with the people they care about, so they had a feeling of belonging."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"You're right, Lee."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Huh? I don't understand what the heck you're goin' on about. You're ruinin' the show! Hmph..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"...S-sorry."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"You're right. Let's just sit back and enjoy the show."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"It's also interesting to see another side of people you don't normally see."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"It feels like I'm not a Construct anymore. I feel like I'm just an ordinary person again. No missions. No battles. No worries..."},{"T":"302","2":"That day will come."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...Then my wish will come true."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Whaaat? Wish? Right, right, right! We gotta make a wish on Christmas Eve! My turn!"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"You're right, Nanami. Back in the day, people would make wishes during special occasions. They'd make wishes, then the bells and fireworks would send their wishes to Santa."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Then Santa Claus would climb down their chimneys while everyone was asleep and secretly put gifts under their Christmas tree. My mother told me this story before."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"If that's the case, why don't you try making a wish, Liv?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"How about we wish upon the fireworks together?"},{"T":"301","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"\u2014Nanami! It won't work if you say it out loud!"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Huh? Good grief..."},{"T":"301","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"After some time, the firework show ends, and everyone goes back inside."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Now, it's time for the final phase."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"What is it?! What is it?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Too bad I already know what's about to happen..."},{"T":"302","2":"You better be excited.","4":"The real battle is about to start."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"W-what? Why's the commandant being so mysterious all of sudden?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"You guessed it\u2014time to exchange gifts!"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"I wanna gift! I want TONS of gifts! Hehehe... Gimme ALL the gifts!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"I think I'm going to have an aneurysm... Right when there was peace and quiet, you start making a fuss again."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"I don't care! If I don't get any gifts, then I'll cut the Christmas tree to pieces\u2014HMPH!"},{"T":"301","3":"(Static)"},{"T":"301","2":"Karenina","3":"HEYYYY\u2014!

I'm getting off the comm. I'll rush over there ASAP...!"},{"T":"301","3":"Beep\u2014"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Lucia, Lee... You shouldn't bully Karenina, you two."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Yeah... you two are bullies! You won't give me gifts! You don't like me!"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Settle down, Nanami. You won't miss out on any gifts."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Hehe, you sure are amazing, Liv."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Huh? Did I say something wrong?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"What Lucia means is, being the star of the show today really suits you."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Who, me?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"When someone mentions Christmas gifts, I'm sure you think of the old man with a white beard\u2014Santa Claus."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"He's in charge of delivery Christmas gifts all over the world."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Unfortunately, Santa won't be visiting us... More precisely, we couldn't afford one..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Luckily, we have the commandant."},{"T":"302","2":"Um... I'm Santa?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"What are you talking about, Lee? Is your frame overheating again?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Who's idea do you think it was to have this Christmas celebration? Without the commandant's support, we wouldn't be here today."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"And the name of this battle is\u2014'Operation Celebrate Christmas to Cheer Up Liv'\u2014so our host is liv."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Huh?! I just saw how hard everyone was working and wanted..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"That may be so, but the commandant has been worried about you.

What's the point in that?"},{"T":"302","2":"So..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...Hmm?"},{"T":"302","2":"How about a picture to remember our first Christmas together?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"...A picture? That's it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Rationally speaking, the commander's choice is obviously well thought out... No, it can be said that it's the perfect choice."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"A group photo can be taken with you and kept for a long time.
