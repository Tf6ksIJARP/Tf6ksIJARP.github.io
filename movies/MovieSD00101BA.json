I'm a little embarrassed. Is this really worthy of being called a gift? Will the commandant think I'm just being coy..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"If I can find a good time... When it's just the two of us... I will...!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...Liv, she... always seems worried... Is that why?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"...Can you just drop it? You always have to... get down to the bottom of everything..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...But the commandant..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"...The commandant is busy enough as is... Our business can't be..."},{"T":"302","2":"(Approach quietly...)"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Ah?! Commandant?"},{"T":"302","2":"I heard you talking about Liv."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Did you hear everything?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"(Sighs) Guess we have no other choice but to tell you."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Here's the situation, Commandant. Something seems to be on Liv's mind recently."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"It's not affecting her M.I.N.D. stability, but I'm worried that it's affecting her performance on missions."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Agreed. After all, we've already been notified about the start time for our next mission."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"So I've been thinking about how to cheer Liv up."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"I know you've been really busy recently, so I was just discussing it with Lee. I wasn't expecting to drag you into this."},{"T":"302","2":"We're a team."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"You should've taken the commandant into consideration, Lucia."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Sorry, Commandant! I just don't want you to worry about us."},{"T":"302","2":"It's alright."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Now then, Lucia, fill the commandant in with everything you just told me. After all, our decision is up to the commandant anyway."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Well, this all started more than ten days ago, at the beginning of the month."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"That day, as usual, I went to Liv's room to ask her about maintenance."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"But seeing her frown, I figured I'd find something else to talk about and put her heart at ease."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"\u2014Speaking of, everyone's always out on missions. We don't have any time for a break. I'm sure you'd be happy with a vacation, right?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"That really got her attention."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Vacation...? Feels like I haven't heard that word in ages."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Well, we belong on the battlefield. It's not like the Corrupted ever take a day off."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"However\u2014the missions haven't been as urgent recently. I'm sure if you talked with the commandant... you could get some time off."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"...Even you take time off, Lucia? But if it was a real vacation, then... Um..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"That reminds me! Speaking of vacation, it's almost 'that time'!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"'That time'?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Christmas! It only comes once a year! When humans still lived on the surface, everyone always looked forward to it!"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Whenever someone would mention a holiday vacation, it was always during Christmas!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"I heard that Christmas used to be a festival to commemorate the birth of a prophet. At least, that's what that 'Sister' told me."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"But I've never celebrated Christmas..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"So it goes like this... Every Christmas, the entire city becomes alive and bustling."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Um... Like when refugees run away during an air strike?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"...Only you'd put it like that, Lucia. Um... No. It's not like that. Around Christmas time, everyone is relaxed, cheerful, and stress-free."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Christmas trees line the streets, colorful lights decorate houses, and parents prepare gifts for their children..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Children go play outside in the snow and have snowball fights until someone calls them back home for Christmas Eve dinner."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Everyone gets together to eat and talk. It may seem small, but it's a time of joy."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Seems like you sure have some fond memories."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Well... its not like that. I don't remember my family ever celebrating Christmas..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...Why?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"I... I don't know."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"I just remember always being jealous of the kids from normal families. I always wanted to celebrate Christmas with my family just like them..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"It's sad to think about it. Now that I'm a Construct, I'll never have a chance to be with my family, let alone celebrate Christmas with them."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Well, you can ask the commandant to have some time off."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Can I... really?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"But... I... Forget it..."},{"T":"302","2":"So Liv wants to celebrate Christmas..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Seems like it."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Maybe I shouldn't have brought the topic up with Liv... But seeing how much it would mean to her, I don't want her to be disappointed."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"But didn't you already give Liv advice?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Like ask the commandant for some time off?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"It's a strange concept to me, but maybe combining work and rest will be more beneficial for performing missions."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"And this is also a good opportunity for our team members to get a better understanding of each other. Removing social barriers between each other should prove beneficial to future operations."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Lee, you mean..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Yes."},{"T":"302","2":"I have no problem with it."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Sorry?"},{"T":"302","2":"Even if we're on a mission..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...What are you saying, Commandant?"},{"T":"302","2":"Did I say anything about not celebrating Christmas?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...Understood. You're right. Babylonia hasn't imposed any restrictions over mission control. As long as circumstances permit, holding a Christmas celebration won't affect our mission."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Speaking of which, I've confirmed that the next mission will be located in a town in the northern region of what was once Russia."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"It's just a simple recon mission. As long as we proceed with caution, we won't encounter any large groups of Corrupted. There shouldn't be any safety concerns."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"The location appears satisfactory."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Location?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Lucia... You can't have Christmas without snow. Correct?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...Really? Think Hassen took this into consideration when he assigned us to the mission?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"You're overthinking it..."},{"T":"301","3":"Simultaneously at Babylonia HQ..."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Achoo\u2014!"},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"That's odd... Is the thermostat broken?"},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"It feels chilly in here."},{"T":"301","2":"Celica","3":"Maybe someone's talking about you? After all, you sent people to Russia to perform a mission in the middle of winter..."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"You know that wasn't entirely up to me, Celica."},{"T":"301","2":"Celica","3":"I had no idea!"},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Enough. Quit playing games. We still have a lot to do."},{"T":"301","2":"Celica","3":"So, Mr. President, when's it my turn for you to send me on a relaxing winter getaway?"},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"I said quit playing games..."},{"T":"301","2":"Celica","3":"Very well, Mr. Hassen... But I think you're spoiling them. Sending a team with such high combat power as Gray Raven is a bit overkill."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"They've had it hard enough as is."},{"T":"301","2":"Celica","3":"..And that's why I supported your decision."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"I hope everything goes according to plan. I don't know if those kids have even seen snow."}]
