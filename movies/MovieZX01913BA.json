[{"T":"301","3":"The team approaches the previously collapsed entrance. However, to their surprise, it remains open as if welcoming everyone."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Based on our previous expedition, it's unlikely that agent Luna is in here. Our top priority should be cleaning up any Red Tide we come across."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"As for Vonnegut, we don't have much intel, but according to Gabriel, there's likely another agent nearby. This is a stealth mission. Avoid direct confrontation with them at all costs."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"That's our safest bet."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"We also don't know if the figure who jumped in before the smoke cleared is still down there."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Think it was Cinderelik or the other agent?"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"No, Vonnegut said there was another intruder."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Then who could it have been?"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"When we were looking for the entrance, there was someone following us just out of our line of sight."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"We couldn't see who it was, but based on their behavior and footsteps having traces of Punishing Virus, I suspect it was an Ascendant. Not to mention, they were familiar with the area."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"When we came in contact with Vonnegut, he said to Gabriel, 'I've enhanced your frame. Don't let her get the best of you like last time.'"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Like last time? We only know of two Ascendants capable of 'getting the best' of Gabriel."},{"T":"302","2":"Was it Luna or Alpha?"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Didn't Vonnegut say he didn't know where Luna was? Maybe it was Alpha."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Yeah, he said that he 'assumed Alpha was going to bring the Gray Raven Gabriel has mentioned.'"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"But I'm not sure if he was misleading us."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"If he really doesn't know where Luna is, it's highly likely that Alpha is nearby."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Looks like we're going into the lion's den. We'd better formulate a plan of action."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Good idea. When I was collecting personnel data, Camu mentioned that there was an unexplored area."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Apparently, it's filled with the Red Tide and has a high Punishing concentration. Before we left, Camu said he wanted to go check it out on his own."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Since Cerberus has their area covered, I think this is our best route forward."},{"T":"301","3":"Chrome points to the dotted line drawn on the terminal."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"This will allow us to traverse the entire undeployed area in the shortest distance."},{"T":"302","2":"Alright, stick to the plan."},{"T":"302","2":"Lucia, lead the way."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Roger."},{"T":"301","3":"Following Lucia, the team fumbles their way through the dimly lit waterway as they deploy the polyfurnaces given to them by Asimov..."},{"T":"301","3":"After reaching 65% coverage, the team has only come across Hetero-Creatures lurking in the depths. There is no sign of Ascendants."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...This seems way too easy."},{"T":"301","3":"No Vonnegut. No Cinderelik. No sign of anyone."},{"T":"301","3":"If they have not already left, then they must be observing the team from the shadows."},{"T":"301","3":"Either way, something does not feel right."},{"T":"301","3":"Chrome suddenly raises his fist, signaling the group to stop."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"While we've been deploying the polyfurnaces, I've noticed that the Red Tide has been flowing in one direction through the pipes."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"I noticed that, too."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Is it flowing toward the greenhouse?"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Correct."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"You mean the Red Tide is concentrated in the greenhouse?"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"I'm not sure. We didn't see any sign of this as we passed it."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Maybe there's a secret room."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Think it has anything to do with Cinderelik's 'Mother'?"},{"T":"301","3":"Chrome puts his hand to the side of his head, pondering the question for a moment."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"It's highly likely. Let's go back and check out the greenhouse since we aren't picking up any interference."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Maybe we can find a clue."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Alright. We need to make sure there aren't any unknown Red Tide storage areas."},{"T":"301","3":"Seeing Lucia's serious expression, you cannot help feeling some nostalgia."},{"T":"301","3":"She no longer looks lost. After the recent events these past few days and gaining control over her M.I.N.D., the disturbance in her memory from transferring into Plume had gradually disappeared."},{"T":"302","2":"Let's go then."},{"T":"301","3":"The group cautiously sneaks into the greenhouse. Aside from a small number of Hetero-Creatures, the room remains as it was before."},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia motions to Chrome, signaling for the group to split up and search for clues."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Hey, why is there a person lying on the floor?"},{"T":"301","3":"In the corner of the dark greenhouse, a Construct is curled up behind a withering plant. He appears to be unconscious."},{"T":"301","2":"Captain Percy","3":"Ersi! That's Ersi!"},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"His M.I.N.D. went into shock, knocking him unconscious. His mobility mods show varying degrees of damage."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Luckily, it appears that the Hetero-Creature didn't discover him hiding in the corner."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"I'll give him some emergency treatment. Continue searching for clues."},{"T":"301","2":"Captain Percy","3":"Th-thank you!"},{"T":"301","3":"Leaving Ersi to Wanshi, the others turn around and continue searching."},{"T":"301","3":"Under the specialized temperature control lights for cultivated plants, there are some rare green plants growing here."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Careful, don't touch these plants. Especially the red part."},{"T":"301","3":"Chrome reminds you quietly, seeing the plants catch your eye."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"They contain the Punishing Virus."},{"T":"302","2":"Why is something like that here?","4":"Plants with the Punishing Virus?"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"I don't know how it works, but the Punishing Virus has begun to evolve biologically. There might also be another possibility..."},{"T":"301","3":"He takes out a sample kit and protective gloves to collect a sample."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"We were in a hurry last time. Now's a good time to take a sample for Asimov."},{"T":"301","3":"Right at that moment, Wanshi finally manages to resuscitate the injured Construct."},{"T":"301","2":"Captain Percy","3":"Ersi!"},{"T":"301","2":"Ersi","3":"Captain... Where's... the commandant?"},{"T":"301","2":"Captain Percy","3":"I'm sorry... He's still missing."},{"T":"301","2":"Ersi","3":"It's all my fault... If my intel hadn't misled the commandant, he wouldn't have gone to such a dangerous place alone."},{"T":"301","2":"Ersi","3":"I thought I could find him, but I got trapped in this damn hornets nest..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Don't worry. We'll get you out of here when we locate the other Construct."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Can you wait here?"},{"T":"301","2":"Ersi","3":"Um, alright..."},{"T":"301","3":"He nods weakly."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Let's keep searching."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"I've looked everywhere, but I couldn't find any switch you can flip and open up a door."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"...Why would there be that kind of a switch in a rundown waterway like this?"},{"T":"301","3":"Chrome stands in the middle of the greenhouse, scanning his surroundings."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"That red tree."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"If the enemy wanted to stop us from finding the 'entrance,' I bet they'd block it with something we wouldn't want to go near."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"You think it's a marker?"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Correct."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Let's check out the tree then."},{"T":"302","2":"Stay alert. No sleeping on the job.","4":"Okay."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Huh...?"},{"T":"302","2":"Eh\u2014I mean, be careful, you know."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia nods, walks up to the tree, checks it carefully, and discovers that it can be moved along with the box next to it."},{"T":"301","3":"After moving the box, you discover a narrow passage in the floor."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Bingo. Let's check it out."},{"T":"301","3":"As soon as the team squeezes out of the narrow passage, you are surprised and momentarily speechless at the strange scene before you."},{"T":"301","3":"The dim light from the sky nourishes the surrounding red trees, and root-like pipes coil around them, revealing a peaceful but strange atmosphere."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Hey, could it be... that 'Mother' Cinderelik mentioned?"},{"T":"301","3":"Everyone looks up to where Kamui is pointing. An indescribable giant hangs from the root-like pipes in the collapsed cave. Its body undulates as if breathing while it syphons nutrients from the Red Tide delivered through a pipe."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"This Hetero-Creature is like a heart."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Is it circulating the Red Tide rather than accumulating it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"You're partially right. By the way it's absorbing nutrients and then excreting them, I'd say it's more like digesting it."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Is that why they haven't evacuated this place?"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Possibly. Seems like we found out why the Red Tide is accumulating here."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Commandant, we don't know its specific composition. But since this is our enemy's primary objective, destroying it should be our top priority."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"I'm sensing abnormally high Punishing concentration. I think its incubating something... But it's not fully developed yet."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"I agree with Lucia. We'd better destroy it, then collect samples for experts to analyze."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"But before we do, we should secure an escape route. Someone should be guarding the door."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"We don't know who we're up against. If they cut off our escape route, we'll drown in the Red Tide meant to feed this monstrosity."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Isn't that why Asimov gave us those... Er, what are these gizmos called again?"},{"T":"302","2":"Polyfurnaces.","4":"The bane of our existence..."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Oh, right. Can't we just shove 'em up there and get the hell out? That way, we kill two birds with one stone!"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Hahaha! Got that right! Deploying these things is a real pain in the ***!"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Can't we just shove 'em up there and get the hell out? That way, we kill two birds with one stone!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"That should work, but stick them in where?"},{"T":"301","3":"The team looks at the monstrosity hanging in the air. It is suspended in deep stasis, unaware of the intruders standing at the entrance to the cave."},{"T":"301","3":"Suddenly, a sound comes from behind everyone."},{"T":"301","2":"??","3":"Wow, what the hell is that? I think I'm going to puke..."},{"T":"301","3":"Everyone turns to see a Construct enter from behind."},{"T":"301","2":"Captain Percy","3":"Reyna! What are you doing here?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Reyna","3":"I was almost just killed by Hetero-Creature, that is, until a Construct saved me out of nowhere."},{"T":"301","2":"Reyna","3":"But she left right after she saved me. I was looking for a way out when I ran into Ersi up there."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Now that the three of you are here, hurry up and get Ersi out of here."},{"T":"301","2":"Captain Percy","3":"We haven't finished deploying the polyfurnaces. Let me finish helping you."},{"T":"301","2":"Reyna","3":"What's that? You're on a mission?"},{"T":"301","2":"Captain Percy","3":"Reyna, escort Ersi back to safety."},{"T":"301","2":"Reyna","3":"Huh? I never come along for the ride!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Did you run into any other enemies aside from Hetero-Creatures?"},{"T":"301","2":"Reyna","3":"I ran into an Ascendant with white hair, but she didn't seem interested in me. She ran off somewhere in a hurry."},{"T":"301","2":"Reyna","3":"Oh, yeah. Ersi said he ran into a girl with half a wing. But she left after knocking him unconscious."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Was that just dumb luck? Or has the agent that Chrome mentioned already left?"},{"T":"301","2":"Captain Percy","3":"Anyways, let me do my part."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"In that case, guard the entrance with Wanshi. Let us know if there's any danger ASAP."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Lucia and I will try to destroy the Hetero-Creature in the middle."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Reyna, do as your captain orders. Take Ersi out of here."},{"T":"301","2":"Reyna","3":"But, I'll get lost!"},{"T":"301","2":"Captain Percy","3":"Then stand guard at the entrance with us. We'll evacuate once the mission is over."},{"T":"301","2":"Reyna","3":"Yes, Captain!"}]
