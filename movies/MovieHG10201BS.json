[{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"The only directive we have left in this area is to set up the network routing. You can handle the terminal calibrations, right, Liv?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Yes. Leave it to me."},{"T":"301","3":"After the battle, Lee immediately starts setting up various pieces of equipment he brought with him. Liv pitches in as well, sharing the computational load and calibrating each piece as they are put in place."},{"T":"302","2":"Is there anything I can help with?","4":"Where's Lucia?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"There shouldn't be anything else that requires your attention anymore, Commandant. Perhaps you should check on Lucia? She has been off on her own after missions recently."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Is it because... she doesn't feel as close to us as she used to?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"I don't think that's likely, but you should check it out, Commandant. Just to be safe."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"She should be over in that clearing up ahead... It's a good idea to check on her, Commandant."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Ha...!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"No... I should be driving this slash with from left hand..."},{"T":"301","3":"You follow Lee's recommendations to find Lucia alone in the staging area. She swings her sword at nothing, the edge whistling through the empty air, but her cuts do not flow from one to the next."},{"T":"301","3":"After each swing, she retracts her arm and murmurs to herself, as if talking herself through the moves."},{"T":"302","2":"Lucia!","4":"What are you doing?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Commandant... Is it time for our next assignment? Sorry, I got a bit carried away."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"I am studying the forms used by the Lotus and Dawn frames."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Now that you're here, though, could you help with my techniques of sword-fighting?"},{"T":"302","2":"You're the expert here.","4":"Of course."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...I'm not asking for you to teach me how to fight, Commandant. It's about my preferred styles and previous habit."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Thank you! I knew you'd say yes... Uh, I mean, prior data shows that Commandant tends to agree to such requests."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"As you are well aware, Commandant, I am Lucia... but also not quite Lucia. This often leads to deviations that affect squad cohesion."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"That's why I study the data so thoroughly: so I can get back to who I was."},{"T":"302","2":"Then how should I help you?","4":"There's no need to force it."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"I'm... I don't think I'm forcing anything. I'm just... trying to treasure what I still hold."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Well... Could you please observe my movements, Commandant?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"The memories in my M.I.N.D. show that the old Lucia has trained under your supervision before. Hence, you should be familiar with Lucia's attack patterns and postures."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"You can guide me to better synchronize my frame reflexes with the previous iteration of my consciousness, and I can adapt to this body much faster and reclaim its lost strength."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"So..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Sorry, Commandant, could I trouble you to come here for a moment?"},{"T":"301","3":"Just as Lucia readies her blade, Lee's voice rings in through the team channel. On the video feed, Liv's face turns forlorn at the sound."},{"T":"302","2":"What's the matter?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Some of the equipment we've just configured requires your biometrics to unlock. Sorry... I should have known."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"If that's the case, let's head back together, Commandant."},{"T":"302","2":"You're not going to train?","4":"I can go by myself."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"No. We don't have enough time for a full regimen anyway. The training can wait."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"While the area has been cleared of hostiles, it is still unwise for you to move unescorted. I shall accompany you."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Commandant? Could we... hold hands, on the way back?"},{"T":"302","2":"What for?","4":"I don't see why not..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"This is just part of the memory pairing process. To confirm peripheral data."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"That's wonderful... even though we can't keep training, we can still verify other memory data while on the move."},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia quickly sheathes her blade and grips your free hand. The moment your hands touch, you distinctly feel a faint tremor in hers."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Oh... it... it's... I\u2014"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Lucia puts her other hand on top of the first, cradling your own."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Nngh...?! Mmm..."},{"T":"301","3":"You feel another tremor, bigger this time, travel from her hands to yours. But just as you try to move your hand..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Sorry, Commandant, please excuse me...!"},{"T":"301","3":"Letting go of your hand, Lucia turns and runs in the other direction as fast as she can."}]
