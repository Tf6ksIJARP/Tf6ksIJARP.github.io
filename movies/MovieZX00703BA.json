If the commandant was drawn in by that..."},{"T":"302","2":"I'll be careful."},{"T":"301","2":"Karenina","3":"It's all your fault.

If they weren't being slowpokes, we wouldn't have been sealed off!"},{"T":"301","2":"Karenina","3":"And it's not like the Gray Ravens would get into any trouble even if our mission failed!"},{"T":"301","2":"Karenina","3":"Okay, I'm done venting."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"I'm terribly sorry. I'm already trying to find a new path forward through the complicated ruins structure. I know I'll find it soon."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Liv, you shouldn't be too harsh on yourself. The Corrupted in the ruins won't be going anywhere."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Ah, no, it's not that, Lee..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Bianca, is Kamui still moving?"},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"No, he's stopped."},{"T":"302","2":"He found his target?"},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"From our current available information, likely."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Liv, how much longer do you need?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"I'm still analyzing the data.
