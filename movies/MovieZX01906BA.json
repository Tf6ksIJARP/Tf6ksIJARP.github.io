Whaddaya say, Captain?"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Wait... Wanshi, who do you think Cinderelik meant by 'Mother'?"},{"T":"301","3":"Wanshi ponders the question a while, then quietly spits out a series of unlikely explanations."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Based on the word, Mother could refer to... one of the agents mentioned earlier, a Corrupted... or even a new type of Hetero-Creature."},{"T":"301","3":"Chrome still has concerns, considering that, whatever the true identity of this 'Mother' figure is, it will only put the team in danger of being attacked."},{"T":"301","3":"He nods to Kamui and Wanshi, signaling them to leave the greenhouse."},{"T":"301","3":"Following Gabriel and Cinderelik, the trio walks down the spacious waterway and arrives at a platform lift."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Why would a platform lift be here in a waterway?"},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"It's not that surprising. We DID just come from an underground greenhouse, after all."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"I don't think this waterway was really built to drain wastewater."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Think the Ascendants stay here often?"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"This place might be connected with City 075. Considering that it was a military facility built to prevent war, I wouldn't be surprised if it served multiple functions."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"From what we've observed along the way, I'd assume it's been abandoned for quite some time."},{"T":"301","3":"Chrome motions to Kamui to keep his voice down. The trio slows their pace, distancing themselves from Cinderelik and Gabriel up ahead."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"This is just a theory, but I think this abandoned corridor was opened on short notice as a response to the Longinus Arsenal."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"And I'm guessing it was abandoned due to the quality of the facility."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"I think you're right. Any more earthquakes, and this waterway is going to collapse."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Why is this the only shoddy part of the facility?"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"A section of the report on City 075 stated that the facility was expanded to isolate the infected prior to developing the serum."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"But the Punishing Virus spread faster than anticipated. The facility was abruptly abandoned before it saw any use."},{"T":"301","3":"As they are talking, Gabriel and Cinderelik disappear around the corner. The trio accelerates their pace to catch up."},{"T":"301","3":"Among the flurry of footsteps, Chrome hears Camu on the Strike Hawk comm link."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"...Where... you guys..."},{"T":"301","3":"Even though the Strike Hawk comm link is more stable than most, his voice intermittently cuts out due to the unique jamming technology of the underground city."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"We're on the platform lift down here in the waterway. What's your location?"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"...Maze... down here."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"I'm... going... platform lift... Wait there."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Alright, we'll wait for you."},{"T":"301","3":"Right as Chrome terminates the comm link, the group sees Cinderelik, who had disappeared around the corner, now floating in the air."},{"T":"301","3":"Even though her damaged wing makes flight toilsome, four fish-like Hetero-Creatures tightly grip the straps on her clothes and pull her upward."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"I guess those straps aren't just for looks! Captain, I want a pair of my own!"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"I'll help you put in a request, but don't get your hopes up."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Now's not the time, though. I wasn't expecting this kind of escape route from them."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Wrong. I'm not going anywhere."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Cinderelik is no longer needed here. I'm more than enough to serve as your guide."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Come with me."}]
