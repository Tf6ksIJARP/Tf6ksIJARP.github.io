Let's... let's talk about it, yeah? Put the sword away, man! You know how much trouble it is to fix up my frame!"},{"T":"301","2":"No. 21","3":"Noctis played his music too loud.

Is it going to rain? The sun's still out, from what I can tell."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Shush."},{"T":"301","3":"Vera stops Noctis from babbling.

It's a slap in their face, and it risks exposing us to the public."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Frankly, I'm not interested in playing house with those Parliament folks... but now's not the best time for us to stand in the limelight."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Therefore, you and your whole shtick... dearest Miss Popular? Better you do it this time instead of Kurono."},{"T":"301","3":"The sweet-looking woman before Collins smiles and fixes her hair."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"I understand. My resume is 'clean' on the surface, at the very least."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Haha, 'clean' my ass... A resume's no good apart from tricking those naive babies anyway. Whatever\u2014intentionally revealing a flaw of ours might get them wary instead."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Anyhow, you're asking me to be the face of the operation, is that so?"},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"On the surface, sure. But you know your actual job description is going to be so much longer."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Ever since what happened, I've been studying what's happening with the commandant. Memory replays from a corrupted Mind Beacon... the data suggests that this condition can't be actively controlled."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Which means it could happen again as long as the commandant exists."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"I'm sure that little brain must be hiding even more secrets. I have a hunch... a strong hunch that the commandant is what I've been looking for."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"You're sure that you can find what you want in that commandant's brain?"},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Ha, of course not! My hypothesis is baseless! But if we only act with absolute certainty, humans would still be nose-picking monkeys and long extinct. Everything beautiful and true is accidental."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Humans don't evolve from monkeys. It's apes if anything."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Thank you for your correction, Rebecca. Of course I know that."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"I've got two pieces of the puzzle now\u2014a corrupted Mind Beacon from entering an Ascendant's M.I.N.D. and the memory replays from its chain reactions. What an accident! Will the pieces match? What pattern will they make?"},{"T":"301","2":"Rebecca","3":"Collins..."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Finding a commandant that can resist a M.I.N.D. corruption and catching an Ascendant... we've successfully taken our first step into a new era of R&D."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"The first and the most important step."},{"T":"301","2":"Rebecca","3":"Collins, sir, please be careful\u2014"},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Huh?"},{"T":"301","2":"Rebecca","3":"I'm certain that the things you said involve top Kurono secrets, and I'm sure it was an accident that you revealed them. I'll pretend I haven't heard any of them. Don't worry."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"No, you don't have to worry. This place isn't bugged or anything."},{"T":"301","2":"Rebecca","3":"You're a high-ranking Kurono officer, and I'm just the middleman between you and the Parliament who doesn't benefit from it all. I don't want my position altered unknowingly."},{"T":"301","3":"Having gotten disrupted by her strong and unwavering words, Collins does not appear to be displeased. Instead, he laughs."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Whatever! If you'd have betrayed us, you'd have done it by now\u2014likewise, you wouldn't be here if Kurono wanted you gone. If I've decided to tell you the truth, it means that, at the very least, I trust you."},{"T":"301","2":"Rebecca","3":"Why does that sound more like a threat..."},{"T":"301","2":"Rebecca","3":"Fine, leave it to me. I don't run away from a mission for the higher-ups."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"That's the attitude! I picked you precisely because of that confidence... I look forward to your work. Let's scour every last inch of that commandant's brain for all the secrets hidden inside!"},{"T":"301","2":"Rebecca","3":"Sir..."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Alright. I've made myself pretty clear."},{"T":"301","2":"Rebecca","3":"Clear... 'enough.'"},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Go, Rebecca. I'm excited to see you shine."},{"T":"301","2":"Rebecca","3":"Don't exaggerate. Have you sent the brief to my terminal? Which Task Force am I getting?"},{"T":"301","3":"Collins crosses his arm in front of his chest and gives Rebecca a gaze."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"You'll find out soon enough.

Clearance... XX001A... Assigned to... Cerberus."},{"T":"301","2":"Chief Advisor","3":"Cerberus? We have a team called Cerberus?"},{"T":"301","2":"Operation Leader","3":"Missions for Cerberus are usually issued by the Chief Commander through direct channels. This... I've honestly no idea what's going on."},{"T":"301","2":"Chief Advisor","3":"I see... But their recent mission logs have all been cleared, and all their operation statuses are marked 'transferred.' It can't be...?"},{"T":"301","2":"Operation Leader","3":"Don't ask about things we shouldn't know. Even I only know that they're related to the experimental remote connections... I've never seen their 'commandant.' If they're getting assigned through us instead..."},{"T":"301","2":"Operation Leader","3":"Anyway, if the operation is assigned through us, then it's our job. Give me the status of Cerberus."},{"T":"301","2":"Chief Advisor","3":"One sec."},{"T":"301","3":"The Advisor taps on the keyboard in front of his terminal, his fingers jumping between keys, as rows of search results are listed on the holo-screen."},{"T":"301","2":"Chief Advisor","3":"Cerberus, status: standing by at the base."},{"T":"301","2":"Operation Leader","3":"Move the mission directly to the assignment terminal at the forward operating base.

That's the easiest part of our day sorted."},{"T":"301","2":"Chief Advisor","3":"The easiest part?"},{"T":"301","3":"The operation leader takes out a black folder hidden in his coat, the cover marked with 'Clearance: Omega-7'."},{"T":"301","2":"Operation Leader","3":"Get me a deployment officer with high clearance and two logistics officers... as well as a field commander from the Task Force."},{"T":"301","3":"His order is quickly issued, and within moments, the operation leader and the chief advisor are joined by people in different uniforms, all looking ready and prepared."},{"T":"301","2":"Operation Leader","3":"Deployment officer, you're... going to distribute the units and supplies I'm about to mention in a reasonable fashion among the usual mission assign sequence. I don't want anyone outside of those here to notice anything."},{"T":"301","2":"Deployment Officer","3":"Roger."},{"T":"301","2":"Operation Leader","3":"Logistics? You're going to figure out how to procure a set of scouting equipment and non-lethal weapons from the logistic pipeline for 'training needs.' I'll ask the Task Force to give you the details later."},{"T":"301","2":"Field Commander","3":"Sir, may I ask\u2014what operation is this, exactly?"},{"T":"301","2":"Operation Leader","3":"We're tracing a bio-signal, confirming the target's exact coordinates and maintaining observation if possible. Watch out for possible resistance, but control the impact\u2014it's a direct order from the 'highest ups.'"},{"T":"301","3":"The operation leader waves his black folder at the field commander."},{"T":"301","2":"Field Commander","3":"...Whose bio-signal?"},{"T":"301","2":"Operation Leader","3":"...\u3010kuroname\u3011, the commandant of Gray Raven from Babylonia."},{"T":"301","2":"Field Commander","3":"The target of the deployment..."},{"T":"301","2":"Operation Leader","3":"\u2014Is the exact same commandant.

She catches hints of fragrance from their soap, from their food... Scents that reassure and comfort her."},{"T":"301","3":"But No. 21 also notices the pills, the chains, and the oil used to polish firearms. They remind her of the research institute where she stayed... as well as 'that place.'

The sense of danger does not come from the human but the black-clad figures around."},{"T":"301","3":"With one look, No. 21 recognizes that the tense figures in black have weapons hidden among their briefcases. The sense of familiarity further grabs ahold of her, digging up the word 'Kurono' from her repressed memories."},{"T":"301","3":"She remembers her last mission months ago and how the scent of 'Kurono' has been lingering in her M.I.N.D."},{"T":"301","3":"Does this human know of the danger?
