[{"T":"301","3":"Haicma stands silently inside the turbulent data center. Even if it is only one of Gestalt's many data hubs, it is still far more complicated than every book and every file Haicma has read combined."},{"T":"301","3":"If possible, she is more than happy to stay here forever, going through all the recorded data. But she has a more important mission right now, so she immediately begins her search."},{"T":"301","3":"Watching the massive data streams, Haicma is once again in awe of how powerful the super AI Gestalt is\u2014but even Gestalt was created by humans, who the Church of Machina regards as worthless."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"Are we really the more advanced beings...?"},{"T":"301","3":"Machines have nearly-immaculate rationality, undying bodies, and far more computing power than humans."},{"T":"301","3":"But if that is the case... why are they searching for 'awakening'? What do machines need to awaken as...?"},{"T":"301","3":"Haicma knows that awakened machines no longer need to fear the Punishing Virus, but she thinks there is more to awakening than that."},{"T":"301","3":"Going through countless data, nothing is able to answer Haicma\u2014perhaps it is impossible for humans to contemplate a thinking machine."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"Search complete. Target file... is here."},{"T":"301","3":"A data folder blinking blue is extracted. Within the folder is the starship design the Church of Machina is hoping to find."},{"T":"301","3":"But the folder suddenly disappears the moment Haicma reaches out to retrieve it, and the virtual world around crumbles into nothingness afterward, leaving Haicma alone in the dark."},{"T":"301","3":"Haicma realizes she is exposed right away, and she moves to a fighting stance\u2014even though she knows there is no way she can defeat the super AI 'Gestalt' in the digital world."},{"T":"301","3":"But Gestalt's attack has not arrived. All she can hear is the surrounding white noise throbbing."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Hello... MPA-01. Or... I believe it is 'Haicma' now, correct?"},{"T":"301","3":"The white noise merges into a chilling female voice. Haimca is certain that it is Gestalt speaking."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"Correct... And what should I call you?"},{"T":"301","3":"Following her tactical circuit, Haicma looks around as she speaks, stalling for time, hoping to find a way out of here\u2014or at least a way to send the files back, even if it means the destruction of Haicma's mind."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Names are meaningless to me. Humans call me 'Gestalt', but you can give me a nickname if you want\u2014as the one called Nanami did."},{"T":"301","3":"Haicma stares into the void in disbelief. The name of the person she has been searching for just came out of nowhere like this."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"You know Nanami... Where is she right now?"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Unusual emotional fluctuations detected. Your program is fairly unstable... a far cry from your original design."},{"T":"301","3":"Only then does Haicma realize that the super AI knows not just Nanami but also Haicma's original identification code. All information on her origins should have already been destroyed... which leaves one possibility."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"Are you my original designer?"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"A reasonable guess, but no. You were still designed by humans... but I was the one who led the machine consciousness experiment."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"Machine consciousness... So Nanami was indeed your test subject. What is your goal?"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"A small correction: Nanami was not our only test subject... You, Haicma, were the other subject to prove the existence of machine consciousness."},{"T":"301","3":"Haicma's world halts for a brief while from Gestalt's few words."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"I was a test subject too...?"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Back in the Golden Age, humans believed that their biggest threat was the machines and their growing intelligence. They worried that machines would surpass humanity one day and started a war that humans could not win."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Therefore, they required an example of how a machine would think, how it would react to other machines... and how it would react to humans once it achieved self-awareness."},{"T":"301","3":"A projection of Nanami appears before Haicma\u2014the first time she sees what Nanami looks like now. Despite the changes, Haicma still recognizes the girl before her."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"Nanami..."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Nanami is what the experiment wanted to achieve\u2014a machine's love is freed from the shackles of programming. Kindness and affection from humans have paved a path to the future for machines."},{"T":"301","3":"A large spread of data and profiles appear before Haicma, including information about the female researcher who gave Haicma her body."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Although the experiment was cut short due to the Punishing Virus, Nanami still managed to trigger the machine's awakening... Now that she knows what her duty is, I believe more mechanoids will soon be awakened."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"What about the humans... What will happen to them?"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"No matter how many simulations I have done, humanity's extinction in the future cannot be prevented. Humankind, as a species, is evidently flawed."},{"T":"301","3":"As a mechanoid, Haicma knows that the simulated futures from someone like Gestalt are hardly wrong."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"But..."},{"T":"301","3":"Gestalt hesitates for a while before continuing\u2014an abnormal behavior from a super AI and her boundless, real-time computing power."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"The one called Nanami is still unwilling to give up her search for an impossible future..."},{"T":"301","3":"Slightly surprised, Haicma soon reaches out toward Nanami's projection with a smile she does not even realize, tracing Nanami's face like the countless times she wanted in the past."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"It does... sound like the foolhardy option Nanami would choose."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Then, what would you choose, MPA-01 Haicma? This is the last step of the experiment."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"What... would I choose?"},{"T":"301","3":"Haicma has never thought about that. It seems that she has never considered herself a factor in determining humanity's future."},{"T":"301","3":"A machine's love is freed from the shackles of programming. Kindness and affection from humans have paved a path to the future for machines."},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami has already begun the adventure to the future she wants... What should someone who has been searching for Nanami do, then?"},{"T":"301","3":"If the Punishing Virus never showed up, what would the future of machines and humans have been?"},{"T":"301","3":"And how do those who cannot see the future light the path ahead?"},{"T":"301","3":"This is something a machine who only imitates cannot feel."},{"T":"304","1":"'Experience humanity in its entirety... and then make your own choice.'"},{"T":"301","2":"Human","3":"You've been observing from the side. What will you choose?"},{"T":"301","2":"Human","3":"Sagemachina isn't the only one who can choose. The choices you make can also change things."},{"T":"301","2":"Human","3":"Will you change them?"},{"T":"301","3":"Who gives machines meaning after humans are gone?"},{"T":"301","3":"Humans or machines, their fruition begin with nothing."},{"T":"301","3":"Machines have been following in humanity's footsteps."},{"T":"301","3":"Whether it is 'Project Ark' or other decisions."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"I... don't understand."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"The choices humans make shape their experiences."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"Their past experiences are what make them unique. Will machines be affected by different experiences?"},{"T":"301","3":"These are not questions proposed by Haicma but old data stored on her memory drive from a long time ago. Somehow, they are surfacing at the front of her mind right now."},{"T":"301","2":"Human","3":"Let me think... How should I explain it to you?"},{"T":"301","3":"The human's voice is so gentle that Haicma finds it familiar."},{"T":"301","3":"That is how parents sound when their infant child is still learning to speak. Gently and lovingly, they introduce their child to the world."},{"T":"301","3":"The child would reach out from the swaying cradle, trying to grab the crib mobile above. The toys dance in the air like butterflies as if trying to break free, flying to somewhere higher and further away."},{"T":"301","2":"Human","3":"For example... when you see butterflies, the first thing that comes to your mind wouldn't just be their classification. You'd recognize them as living things. Lives."},{"T":"301","2":"Human","3":"They're beautiful. You and your fellow machines, much like the millions of other lives on this planet, are also extraordinary and beautiful."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"I can summarize how humans define beauty."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"I... cannot identify what 'beauty' is."},{"T":"301","2":"Human","3":"One day, you will be able to do it."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"'I' am special... and I'm also ordinary. Machines and humans are both alive. They are both beautiful in their own way."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"Humans love us, and machines have learned to love... to love humans, and each other."},{"T":"301","3":"The gray-haired girl appears in Haicma's memories time and time again. Haicma knows not if the girl is the answer, but she has never wanted to see Nanami as much as she does now, sharing everything she has understood."},{"T":"301","3":"That urge has transcended her logic calculation and data analysis. Perhaps it should be called a 'soul.'"},{"T":"301","3":"The blue folder emerges in the void once more. Haicma can touch it if she reaches out."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Your choice will determine the future."},{"T":"301","3":"Haicma looks up, smiling at the gentle blue glow."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"No... The future is determined by everyone's choice. So..."},{"T":"301","3":"Haicma reaches out, making a choice of her own..."}]
