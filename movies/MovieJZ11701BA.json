[{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"How's it going...?"},{"T":"301","3":"The Kurono researcher briefly salutes Nikola as he enters the research lab before shifting his gaze intensely back at the modification bay separated by a pane of glass."},{"T":"301","2":"Researcher","3":"Looks like everything is going surprisingly smoothly. The orphans have already completed body modifications."},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola nods as the corners of his tightly pursed lips seem to relax ever so faintly."},{"T":"301","2":"Human Soldier","3":"Hmph... Even if the modification is successful, are these kids really suitable for combat?"},{"T":"301","2":"Researcher","3":"We have no other choice. They will serve as test subjects for Tantalum-193 affinity. Most of our data has been collected from orphans like them..."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"How long until modification is complete?"},{"T":"301","2":"Researcher","3":"Um... Well, all that's left now is to install the Inver-Device..."},{"T":"301","3":"The Inver-Device serves as the Constructs' vital defense against the Punishing Virus. It helps stabilize their M.I.N.D. and resist corruption."},{"T":"301","3":"This is humanity's only glimmer of hope in the fight against the Corrupted."},{"T":"301","2":"Researcher","3":"Experiments 0215 to 0220... Inver-Device installation complete. Uploading memory..."},{"T":"301","3":"A deafening silence falls upon the research lab as everyone nervously awaits the final results. This is the closest they have ever come to success."},{"T":"301","2":"Researcher","3":"Upload complete! Upload complete! Memory stable... Preparing resuscitation!"},{"T":"301","3":"The researcher eagerly issues the report, but the others stifle their cheers. If it had not been for Nikola's presence, they would have jumped for joy."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Alright, carry on... This time we can finally..."},{"T":"301","3":"Without warning, an ear-piercing alarm erases the hard-earned smiles off their faces."},{"T":"301","3":"Even though all of the children should have still been under the effects of anesthesia, a feeble body on the operating table curls up in agony and lets out a blood-curdling scream."},{"T":"301","2":"White-haired Girl","3":"Aaaargh!!!"},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Hey! Get away from her!"},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola is the first to react, but he is too late. The girl bursts out from the incubator and sends a nearby bewildered researcher flying into the wall."},{"T":"301","2":"Researcher","3":"Corruption... critical... and rising!"},{"T":"301","3":"Everyone can tell that the little girl has already become a Corrupted."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"...Was she corrupted by the Punishing Virus?"},{"T":"301","2":"Researcher","3":"Impossible! The CPF is operational, not to mention the multiple Iso-Devices in the operating room. How can..."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Impossible? How dare you have the audacity to say such a thing in the face of that?"},{"T":"301","3":"Humanity has the faintest idea about the Punishing Virus... and the intel available is no doubt partially hidden, intentionally or not."},{"T":"301","2":"Researcher","3":"Sir... What should we..."},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola looks at the little girl struggling from the effects of Punishing Virus\u2014her name is Luna, the younger of two sisters who just so happen to come to the foundation."},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"Argh... S-sis... Ahhh!"},{"T":"301","3":"With such a high failure rate, Nikola never bothers to remember their names. But for some reason, the sisters have left an impression on him."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Take her out... before the virus spreads."},{"T":"301","3":"Bitterly, he issues the order through gritted teeth. The surrounding soldiers quietly grip their guns\u2014perhaps out of habit, not compliance."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Look here, minions. Enough chit-chat and freaking out. Your business is done here. Get out of here!"},{"T":"301","3":"The door of the research lab is kicked open as a squad of heavily-armed soldiers pour into the room. A tall middle-aged man stands in front of them, hunched over with a wretched demeanor."},{"T":"301","2":"Human Soldier","3":"Hey! Who do you guys think you are!"},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola immediately stops the commotion, shakes his head and motions for them to comply with the order. Only once all of the soldiers have exited the premises does he speak to the man who burst into the room."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Collins... What brings you here?"},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"These veterans have all passed the test for Tantalum-193 affinity. They are ready to undergo surgery and form a task force to fight the Corrupted."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"I will be in charge of this squad for the time being. Consider me your superior, boy."},{"T":"301","3":"Although he hates being called 'boy,' he does not want to waste any more time with him."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Sorry, I don't have time to reminisce with you, sir. We were just..."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"I know, I know. You just had an incident with the Punishing Virus. A Corrupted appeared here, did it not?"},{"T":"301","3":"Collin pushes Nikola aside and saunters into the research lab, approaching the corrupted Luna."},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"AAAAGGHHH!"},{"T":"301","3":"Unable to control herself, Luna waves her slender arm and smashes it against the reinforced glass separating the operating room and the laboratory. The superhuman force of her arm cracks the multi-layered glass."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Hmph... You see, dear boy. Isn't she a cutie? She wants to kill me with every ounce of her being. Such pure and unbridled malice."},{"T":"301","3":"Collins gently rubs the cracking reinforced glass and looks at Luna. Nikola can even see some semblance of 'craving' in his eyes."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Compared with them, human beings are so much more twisted and complex... Even the act of killing requires them to find a good enough excuse."},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola pulls Collin a safe distance away from Luna and whispers\u2014"},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"What the hell do you know... Collins? What is the Inver-Device? Why does it trigger the Punishing Virus?"},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Believe me, dear boy, I would love\u2014absolutely love\u2014to tell you everything I know. But, I'm sorry, you do not have the clearance... not yet."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Please inform your subordinates that what happened here today is strictly confidential and should not be leaked in any form. Otherwise, we will meet again... in another form."},{"T":"301","3":"Collins puts his hand on Nikola's shoulder and whispers so that only he can hear."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"You and I have survived this long in Kurono because we understand what it means to 'follow the rules.'"},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola shrugs off his hand and leaves without turning to look at him."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"I see."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Dear boy, don't show your teeth unless you know for a fact that your bite would kill..."},{"T":"301","3":"Hearing this, Nikola relaxes his clenched fist\u2014or rather, forces himself to."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Well then, goodbye for now. I'll be waiting for you to reach my level\u2014waiting for you to open your eyes and make up your mind."},{"T":"301","3":"After confirming that Nikola and the other researchers have left the room, Collins turns and stands before the squad members once more."},{"T":"301","3":"Finally, Luna manages to smash through the fortified glass with her continued barrage of attacks. Shattered shards fly past Collins, who remains unflinching as he lets out a wicked grin."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Get to work. Kill the Corrupted and all the potential Corrupted."},{"T":"301","2":"Operation Leader","3":"But... Sir, the other modified children aren't showing any signs of corruption..."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Hehe, is there something faulty with your transmitters? Fine. Let me repeat myself one more time. Kill the Corrupted and all of the potential Corrupted."},{"T":"301","3":"Collins pats the leader on the shoulder, then grins."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"If I have to repeat myself one more time, I'll lose my already very generous temper."},{"T":"301","3":"The leader grits his teeth, then aims his rifle at the group of teenagers dreaming about their new lives as Constructs."},{"T":"301","2":"Operation Leader","3":"Sorry..."},{"T":"301","3":"The dense firepower smothers his words, making him inaudible. The others also join him in his apology, even though no one can bring themselves to say it out loud."},{"T":"301","3":"Collins gently hums among the flashing gunfire, as if reveling in an extraordinary performance. However, his smile quickly sours."},{"T":"301","3":"Although bathed in a storm of bullets, Luna remains standing and walks toward Collins, one step at a time."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"What are you doing... Can't you just stick to the script..."},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"Ugh... Aaargh!"},{"T":"301","3":"Luna covers her head and unleashes a beastly roar, then rushes at Collins with unprecedented speed, but stops right before she can crush his throat."},{"T":"301","3":"Luna desperately grabs her hand in an attempt to suppress her desire to attack Collins, seemingly to Collins' dissatisfaction."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Hey, hey, that's it?!"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Sir! Stay back!!!"},{"T":"301","3":"A nearby soldier rushes forward, knocking Luna to the ground with his gunstock, steps on her, and unloads his magazine into her limbs."},{"T":"301","3":"He empties his magazine and pulls out his pistol to aim it between her eyes, only to discover that Luna begins to weep."},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"Lucia... Sis, where are you?! I wanna go home..."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Corrupted... can cry?"},{"T":"301","3":"Collins grabs the pistol from the dumbfounded soldier and shoots Luna until the magazine is empty."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Hey, what's your name?"},{"T":"301","2":"Hiro","3":"Hiro... (Clears throat) Hiro, sir!"},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Hiro, my dear boy. Regardless if they look human or not, there's nothing human about a Corrupted. Any sign of emotion might just be a trick to catch you off guard."},{"T":"301","2":"Hiro","3":"But she was still human a few minutes ago..."},{"T":"301","3":"Collins gives Hiro a swift kick in the rear."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"You won't have much longer to live if you don't quit acting so gullible. Or do you want to hurry back to Mommy?"},{"T":"301","2":"Hiro","3":"Yes... sir..."},{"T":"301","2":"Operation Leader","3":"About the Corrupted and potential Corrupted... How should we dispose of them?"},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Throw them in the trash disposal facility where they belong. I'll leave the trash to you..."},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"Collins looks at the ravaged Luna and sighs before waving at his subordinates, then walks away."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Hmph... I'm always left to take out the trash. Can't something happen to get the blood pumping for a change?"},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Like the arrival of mankind's true savior! Or... the birth of the last destroyer of mankind! What do you have to say about that?"},{"T":"301","3":"The officer nods in confusion, not knowing what his superior is going on about."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Hmph... What a bore..."}]
