That's our target for this mission."},{"T":"302","2":"Let's report for duty first."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Right, the temp HQ should be... Ah, over there."},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia checks her surroundings, then fixes her eyes on a makeshift building in the center of the base. The white flowers and pink ribbons on the exterior of the temporary headquarters serve as a stark contrast with the surrounding charred city ruins."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Someone's sure got a strange taste."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Don't assume, Lee. Maybe they serve a special purpose."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Perhaps."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Alright, go report for duty.

I don't know why, but I sure get a kick out of hearing the commandant call me that!"},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Oh?

You really haven't changed a bit."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"But if that's how you view them, I have no interest in getting involved.
