The destination of this mission now lies right before Chrome's eyes."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"The objective of this mission is to occupy this Corrupted spawning ground. Strike Hawk and the other teams will stay behind in Zone C to attract and contain any and all hostile entities."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"(This other team is... actually...)"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"You've briefed me on the mission countless times, remember?"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Countless times, you say?"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"You've been saying the same thing over and over since we got on the aircraft.
