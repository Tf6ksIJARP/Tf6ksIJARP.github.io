She has seen them wandering by the road. Lucia told her never to go near those monsters."},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"Ahhhhhhh!"},{"T":"301","3":"Luna throws the hand away and jumps back, accidentally tripping over something else on the ground."},{"T":"301","3":"She can feel the agonizing pain from the wounds all over her body, but the real pain comes from a strange feeling in her mind."},{"T":"301","3":"A peculiar noise clamors by her ears as if trying to tell her something.

Where are you...?"},{"T":"301","3":"There is no warmth from a bonfire. No warmth from her sister. Only the cold, uncaring darkness."},{"T":"301","3":"Her eyes brim with tears at the thought of her sister. She can barely stop herself from crying out loud."},{"T":"301","3":"But right at that moment, a dull low roar comes from deep within the darkness. Luna clasps her mouth shut, too afraid to cry any longer."},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"Is that what my sister warned me about\u2014the monster?!"},{"T":"301","3":"The low roar and abrasive sound of dragging feet draw near... Closer and closer... Step by step..."},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"It's... it's coming this way!"},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"Lucia said that monsters only hide in the dark because they're afraid of the light. If only there was any..."},{"T":"301","3":"Luna looks around to see a small hill emitting a blinding red light."},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"If I can just make it over there, the monster won't come any closer!"},{"T":"301","3":"She makes up her mind, and runs with all her might toward the glowing red light."},{"T":"301","3":"But as she approaches the red light, she finally discovers its source\u2014"},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"C-Corrupted..."},{"T":"301","3":"The upper half of a Corrupted lies on top of a waste pile.

Argh!"},{"T":"301","3":"The Corrupted reaches out toward Luna. All she can do is stand there helplessly."},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"Lucia... Where are you...?"},{"T":"301","3":"Her eyes brim with tears once more. She has seen countless people ravaged by Corrupted. Those are the monsters that lurk in the dark, waiting to devour humanity."},{"T":"301","3":"But to her surprise, the Corrupted does not attack her. It gradually relaxes its grip and becomes dormant once more."},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"Hm..."},{"T":"301","3":"In the dim red glow of the Corrupted, Luna finally sees what has been causing her such pain\u2014bullet holes on her body."},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"Is this... me...?"},{"T":"301","3":"Those imposing men said that she would grow a bit after her body was turned into a Construct to improve her combat ability."},{"T":"301","3":"But what fills her with despair now is the glowing red light coming from her wounds\u2014the same red light as the Corrupted."},{"T":"301","2":"(Noise)","3":"Corruption... critical... and rising!"},{"T":"301","2":"(Noise)","3":"\u2014Take her out... before the virus spreads."},{"T":"301","2":"(Noise)","3":"\u2014Get to work.

I'm a... monster?"},{"T":"301","3":"The voice echoing in Luna's ear gradually becomes noisy but clear as it approaches, getting so close like it is whispering."},{"T":"301","2":"(Noise)","3":"Desire... Impulse... A higher purpose..."},{"T":"301","2":"(Noise)","3":"Destroy... humanity... for the sake of... humanity..."},{"T":"301","3":"In the glowing red light, Luna hears someone talking. But to her surprise, the voice comes from her own mouth."},{"T":"301","2":"'Luna'","3":"Humanity must be filtered... There is no escape... There is no survival..."},{"T":"301","2":"'Luna'","3":"Ascend to a higher purpose... You are the agent... You are its will!"},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"No...

If you ever get lost, just stay where you are and don't do anything."},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"Don't do anything...? Is that it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Yes... Because I'll be able to find you, wherever you are... Even if you become something else, I'll always be able to find you. I promise."},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"I'll wait for you, Lucia... I'll always wait for you!"},{"T":"301","3":"The noise echoing in her ears gradually weakens, and the corruption's grip on Luna begins to loosen miraculously. Once the blood-red light dissipates, Luna falls into a deep slumber."},{"T":"301","3":"Silence fills the abandoned facility once more, punctuated only by occasional murmurs from Luna lost in her dreams."},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"Lucia..."},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"Lucia...
