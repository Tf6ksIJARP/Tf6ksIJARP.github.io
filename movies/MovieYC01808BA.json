The oppressive ruins around her begin to give way, exposing the familiar architecture before her."},{"T":"301","3":"Liv charges in the direction of the gunshot to discover \u3010kuroname\u3011 pointing a gun at Vanessa."},{"T":"301","3":"After \u3010kuroname\u3011 shoots, Lee follows in turn by drawing his guns and pointing them at Teasell and Bambinata. The two opposing Constructs raise their weapons and point them at the Gray Ravens.

You won't be getting out of this that easily, \u3010kuroname\u3011."},{"T":"302","2":"I won't let you continue to insult my comrades and our soldiers so easily either."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Soldiers? Do you think dolls that resemble humans are worthy of being called soldiers?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"They're nothing more than toys and tools to serve humanity's bidding."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Are you so naive as to think everyone who has chosen to become a Construct really wishes to save the Earth?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"As a commandant, you should know that Babylonia has given us preferential treatment when it comes to resources."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Follow my orders until the end of the war, and I can assure you as many Constructs as you need. Bored of your toys? Are your toys broken? Replace them as you see fit."},{"T":"302","2":"They're not toys to be played with."},{"T":"302","2":"They have they own thoughts.

Guess you're not dead. How disappointing... Seeing you this filthy is appalling."},{"T":"301","3":"Just as Vanessa is about to continue ridiculing Liv, she takes Lucia's blade and cuts off her long hair."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Vanessa, this is the artificial hair you picked for me."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"I have obeyed your orders because I'm bound to my duty as a soldier.

A long silence fills the streets."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"?!"},{"T":"302","2":"It's over, Vanessa."},{"T":"301","3":"Vanessa stands there and ponders for a few moments, then takes Teasell and Bambinata down the street, disappearing around the corner."},{"T":"301","3":"After confirming that the Egret team had left, Liv relaxes her clenched hands. Her long white hair flutters away in the hot wind on the battlefield."},{"T":"301","3":"Lee ignites the flare, signaling that the area has been cleared. After cleaning his weapon, he begins to think about how to improve his frame's resistance to EMP interference."},{"T":"301","3":"Each unit releases their signal flares, indicating that their areas have all been cleared and that this large-scale operation is drawing to end."},{"T":"301","3":"You let out an involuntary sigh, and your increased heart rate from the conflict finally returns to normal."},{"T":"301","3":"You feel someone gently touch your hands\u2014it's Liv.

I had to tell Vanessa and my former teammates about my will as a soldier and member of the Gray Ravens."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Because this is the most precious thing I have received after meeting you."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"You all have made me face what I've been running away from all this time."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"But from what I know about Vanessa, my behavior... is bound to have a negative impact on the Gray Ravens."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"After going back, I will submit a departure application to the commanding superiors.

Our effectiveness has also improved remarkably."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"I think the current team configuration is... satisfactory.

It can't be focused manually, and can only take video."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Anyway... At least it can capture the moment. If you want to grab any screenshots from it, you can do that later."},{"T":"302","2":"Thanks."},{"T":"301","3":"Looking at the other two, Lucia nods gently."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Just do what the commandant says."},{"T":"301","3":"After confirming that the equipment is operating normally, you step back to find the most appropriate distance."},{"T":"301","3":"You lift your hands and make a square to frame your cherished companions in the shot."},{"T":"302","2":"3..."},{"T":"301","3":"Noticing that Liv appears uneasy, Lucia scoots closer to her, grabs her hand and smiles at her comfortingly."},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia's sudden closeness causes Liv to blush slightly, but her tense shoulders relax."},{"T":"302","2":"2..."},{"T":"301","3":"Standing farther away, Lee hears your deliberately slow counting, sighs gently, then turns to the camera and reveals an awkward expression vaguely passable as a 'smile.'"},{"T":"302","2":"1!"},{"T":"301","3":"Oddly enough, none of them are very good at expressing their feelings. However, they have already begun to detect each other's thoughts just based on their actions."},{"T":"301","3":"They could all convey their hearts without uttering a word."},{"T":"301","3":"As the disputes in the factory area dissipate, the Gray Ravens' first large-scale operation finally comes to a temporary end."},{"T":"301","3":"Prior to receiving further orders, a gust of wind passes through the city ruins. Although it fails to disperse the smoke over the battlefield, it also brought a moment of peace to the Gray Ravens."},{"T":"301","3":"Although they had won the battle, the war is still underway. More battles, perilous danger and difficult choices await the Gray Ravens."},{"T":"301","3":"However, the Gray Ravens will face the coming adversity together."},{"T":"301","3":"\u2014Lucia, Liv, Lee, and their commandant."},{"T":"301","3":"The electronic photo frame on the table in the lounge finally has a suitable picture."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"So... the Constructs of the Gray Ravens are willing to go this far to protect \u3010kuroname\u3011."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Could my method really... No, my method is the most efficient way to use Constructs."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Bambinata, what are your thoughts?"},{"T":"301","2":"Bambinata","3":"Master..."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Silence. Clearly I don't have my wits about me if I'm asking a toy for advice."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Hehe... \u3010kuroname\u3011, I'll make you regret your decision today sooner or later."}]
