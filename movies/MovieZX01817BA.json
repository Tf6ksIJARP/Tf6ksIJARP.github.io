It came at the cost of a lot of research and sacrifice."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"I see. Guess it ain't easy being a Construct."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"I had no idea technology in the outside world had come this far."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Huh...? You don't know what's going on in the outside world?"},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Don't know, don't care."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"I dunno how long it's been since I left society and started livin' by myself out here in no man's land."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"All I remember is openin' my hatch one day, and the whole world had changed."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"See this hand? I amputated it when it got infected and started to fester. That's why it's modified the way it is now."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Luckily, this pile of protective gear only came at the cost of a hand."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Wow... Impressive."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Of course! Who the hell do you think I am?! Who hadn't heard of Arnold back then..."},{"T":"301","3":"Listening to Arnold speak, the sphere bot handing him tools suddenly kicks him in the face."},{"T":"301","2":"Sphere Bot","3":"Bzzrt! BzzZZzzrrt!"},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"****! I completely forgot. Thanks for remindin' me, bud."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"?"},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"It's all right. Enough 'bout the past. I've long abandoned everything I once had."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"As for the protective equipment, it ain't as powerful as you, little buddy."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"I built this little guy out of scrap metal I picked up from the dump. There's just enough to keep me goin'."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Me and my partner are like on an island cut off from the outside world."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"I see..."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Think I can borrow that buddy of yours, Arnold?"},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Sure. What for?"},{"T":"301","3":"Arnold stops his work and grabs a water bottle from the cabinet off to the side. He squeezes it into his mouth, but only a few drops dribble out."},{"T":"301","3":"After that, Arnold throws the water bottle aside, then grabs the sphere bot off his shoulder and tosses it next to Wanshi."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Try connecting it to my temple."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Like this?"},{"T":"301","3":"Arnold pulls a connector from the back of the sphere bot and attaches it to Wanshi's head."},{"T":"301","3":"The surrounding environment suddenly changes. The dingy underground room becomes a spacious white city. The bricks and stones that built the city pour out from the ocean above, pass through Arnold and Wanshi, then splice into various buildings within the city."},{"T":"301","3":"The architecture changes styles continuously. In an instant, the city goes from magnificent European halls, to mottled urban ruins, then to a blood-red Dead Zone."},{"T":"301","3":"Light and shadows alternate rapidly in the city. The boundary between day and night begins to blur."},{"T":"301","3":"The white city continuously alters its shape. Refracted sunlight shines from above, unveiling a blue ocean of data behind it."},{"T":"301","3":"Various buildings and images reflect in the ocean, waiting for the two divers to give instructions."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"??!"},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Well... I think this will give you a glimpse of the outside world."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"What's this? Is this what the city looks like now...? Is that the ocean up there?"},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Well... That's the data stream up there. It just looks like the ocean is all."},{"T":"301","3":"Arnold is stunned for a moment as he scans the changing scenery around him."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Survey work... Is tedious. So I asked someone to modify the projection recording function."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"I can basically reproduce what I've seen from the data stream overhead."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"That sure is convenient. You can even see..."},{"T":"301","3":"Arnold shakes his head, aware of what he was about to ask."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Forget it..."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"I stopped carin' about the past ages ago."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Show me where people live now."},{"T":"301","3":"The surrounding city folds in on itself, revealing Babylonia."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Well... The old cities were mostly destroyed by the war."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"So everyone basically lives in Babylonia."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Babylonia... I thought it was only under development. Not that it was already finished."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Good thing you know about Babylonia. Saves me from having to explain it..."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"That's amazing. Humans have ascended to the heavens."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"The heavens...? I guess you could say so."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"In short, human beings live, develop and proliferate in preparation to recapture Earth at every moment."},{"T":"301","3":"The scene of Babylonia gradually transitions to display the flow of people and Construct soldiers being sworn into action."},{"T":"301","3":"On the other side, cities have devolved into battlefields. Constructs continue to charge Corrupted fighting and dying in battle."},{"T":"301","3":"Scenes of devastation appear around Arnold and Wanshi. Survivors and Constructs fight bravely against the Corrupted unleashing destruction on the surface."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Is this really the world we live in?"},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Why are we tryin' to recapture Earth?"},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Why...? I still don't know the answer to that question."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"You've thrown yourself into this war, and you ain't got an answer? Is it because you're lookin' for one?"},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"No, I don't think so."},{"T":"301","3":"Without the help of the sphere bot, Arnold has to get the repair tools himself.

You mean the Punishing Virus?"},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"No, the planet was sick long before that."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"The cities and societies of the past were all sick."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Maybe the virus and monsters that are now spreading outside are punishment for the diseased society of the Golden Age."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"While mankind enjoys a prosperous life, it breeds a source of disease known as corruption and degeneration."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Does humanity really need to return to this planet?"},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Maybe we should focus on tomorrow instead of the hopeless things of the past."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"What's the point of sacrificin' so much to recover Earth?"},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"I think it's so mankind can return to Earth one day."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Do you want to return to Earth? Do you really want mankind to have another 'Golden Age'?"},{"T":"301","3":"Finally finding the right tool, Arnold returns to Wanshi and continues work on the next section of repairs."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Honestly... I've had my doubts on the collective goals of mankind for some time now..."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Humanity's path to achieving their goals is paved in whitewashed lies. Yet we continue to work toward this goal."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Hmph... Just like before, huh?"},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"...I've never been determined to win at all costs like those around me."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"In the long war, a ray of hope shines above every Construct. In order to win a menial victory, they use their own flesh and blood to pave the dark road to humanity's ultimate goal."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"I've had countless dreams that humanity ended in tragic defeat. The flame had grown so weak, that darkness finally came. After a brief struggle, the mote was finally extinguished."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"I have thought and tried. But now, I realize that personal efforts pale in significance when faced with our current reality."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"I'm too exhausted to think about answers now..."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Isn't that perfect then? Use this time to abandon this rotten Earth?"},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Throw away all the troubles and thoughts, all the travesties of human history."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Travel to the stars and begin a new era."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"...I can't do that."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Because I've had many dreams about another potential future. Eventually, the surviving humans will bathe in the first light of dawn."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"In this dream, there stands my comrades who have maintained conviction\u2014as am I."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"My comrades look to each other with smiles of satisfaction. The civilization that humanity only spoke of once again becomes a reality."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"We finally return to Earth and save ourselves."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Once confused, cowardly and wavering, I feel an unprecedented emotion standing before such a world... I feel an overwhelming sense of triumph and elation..."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"But that was just a dream."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"I also imagined that humans of the Golden Age would regain their faith that was once so close at heart."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"But dreams will eventually be broken. Humanity is doomed to repeat past mistakes time and time again. Disease will only be followed by new disease."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"You're right. We must all wake up from our dreams eventually. But in making our dreams come true, there is always something within my power."},{"T":"301","3":"Wanshi quickly switches the projection around Arnold. Countless bricks and stones form a war-torn battlefield."},{"T":"301","3":"The projection of the battlefield gradually enlarges, showing Wanshi rushing to the aid of those wounded in an attempt to save them from the throes of death."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"And if we stop here, are we not betraying our comrades? The same comrades we have fought with to achieve this dream? The same dream in which we share in each other's smiles?"},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Bahaha! Looks like you've got more moxie than I thought."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Find something you can do yourself, eh?"},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Nothing great or noble, but a way of life that you can live in your own right."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Yeah... This way of life might be a little selfish..."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"But I hurt a lot of people and Constructs in the past because of what I've done."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"So what? Who cares."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Everyone has their own way of living. You and me both."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"I was a loner during the Golden Age."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"When I came here to get far away from society, I knew the outside world would criticize me."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"But had I not left, I probably wouldn't even be here speakin' with you."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Ain't no one got the right to talk **** about a life of selfishness. In the end, it just depends on your... Cough."},{"T":"301","3":"Smiling only just a moment ago, Arnold erupts into a violent coughing fit. He covers his mouth, but Wanshi sees blood dripping between his fingers."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Arnold, you're..."},{"T":"301","3":"Arnold smiles, wiping the blood from the corners of his mouth, and continues using the tool in his other hand to connect the exposed mechanical circuits."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Ain't nothin' to worry 'bout. I'm used to it. Looks like one of my organs is on the fritz again."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Once you're finished fixing me up, why don't I return the favor and see what's wrong?"},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"You know what the hell you're doin'?"},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"I've had some training in first aid."},{"T":"301","2":"Arnold","3":"Baha! Let me fix ya first, and we'll go from there."}]
