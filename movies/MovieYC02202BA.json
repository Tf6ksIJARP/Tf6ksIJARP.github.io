The defective Construct looks nothing like a flower. Similarly, I have been unable to understand his behavior."},{"T":"304","1":"He obviously has the power to destroy his prey, yet he spends the time to set traps."},{"T":"304","1":"Sometimes he even digresses into boastful monologues, wasting time on pointless communication with the enemy."},{"T":"304","1":"I am skeptical of his inefficient practices, but as long as he is completing the Ascnet's missions, I have no need to speak up."},{"T":"304","1":"The bigger problem I face now is that humanity's nightmare is about to be brought to life, but the generation who should lead us forward doesn't care."},{"T":"304","1":"After reaching this conclusion, I detected a mood fluctuation similar to 'disappointment' in my memory circuit."},{"T":"304","1":"No one seems to pay any mind to this earth-shattering power, but I am sure that this power is the gospel brought to me by the Ascnet."},{"T":"304","1":"As such, I am even more deserving of wielding this power."},{"T":"301","3":"Roland was watching nearby a few times when Gabriel developed Hetero-Creatures."},{"T":"301","3":"He'll never forget how those creatures came out from the slimy eggs."},{"T":"301","3":"They were squirming and twisting and looked absolutely disgusting."},{"T":"301","3":"The deformed Hetero-Creature looks up and stares at the dark 'angel' in front of it."},{"T":"301","3":"Gabriel raises his cane and points it at the Hetero-Creature."},{"T":"301","3":"The back of the Hetero-Creature bulges with pus and then from it breaks transparent wings.

Lock, and then attack."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"They are merely tools at my disposal to achieve the long cherished dream of Ascnet.

I'll await the good news..."},{"T":"301","3":"Gabriel has been searching in the deep pool for the strongest power as he understands. What is now presented to Roland is likely to be the answer to that power."},{"T":"301","3":"The indescribably massive incubator for integrating mechanoid and biological structures is suspended deep underground. Countless tubes flowing with red liquid are connected to it."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"...Babylonia would never have expected this kind of thing to be hidden under the Central Purification Filter that was once the lifeline of the human race. Quite the bold decision."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"I wasn't the one to decide on the position of 'Mother'. The seed merely landed here and successfully germinated."},{"T":"301","3":"Vonnegut looks up at 'Mother', which rises and falls with its regular 'breathing'. He feels reassured."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"This is even better than the 'test subject'."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"This CPF was used by humans to reduce the concentration of the Punishing Virus. But due to the existence of 'Mother', it has turned into a hotbed for it to absorb nutrients."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"In the absence of the Red Tide, this is a place more suitable for 'Mother' than that 'greenhouse.' Unfortunately, Gabriel faltered on his way to uncovering the truth."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"Perhaps, he was 99% of the way to achieving his goal, but it was the 1% he ignored that is key to achieving it. I found this in the Gabriel memory data collected by Cinderelik."},{"T":"301","3":"Speaking with a solemn tone, Vonnegut takes out an old storage device from his pocket."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"Gabriel thinks that emotion is useless, but he deliberately ignored what the turning point was for him becoming an Ascendant."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"Hatred, pain, obsession... These feelings are very familiar to every Ascendant, but they are completely unfamiliar to Hetero-Creatures."},{"T":"301","3":"Standing in front of 'Mother', Vonnegut opens his hands as he explains his theory without hesitation."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"The Hetero-Creatures incubated by Gabriel have given us new possibilities and may have even inspired the Punishing Virus to develop toward intelligent lifeforms."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"However, the newly created Hetero-Creatures cannot feel emotions innate in humans, which means that they lack the primary conditions to pass the 'filtering' process."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"What we need is not a beast with shackles, but a companion who can walk side by side with us in the new world."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Did you call me here just to show off your new pet?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"No, of course not."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"After this, I will give you something else as agreed."},{"T":"301","3":"Vonnegut turns around with a smile and looks at 'Mother' behind him..."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"This is the deal between us\u2014our next step."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"It's an experiment driven by human instinct, shifting against emotions, and producing results from suffering."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"I think you'll be interested in the show, Roland."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Vonnegut... Unbelievable. I can never tell what's on his mind."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"To let something come into being that he's not sure if he can control... Is that what he really wants? Didn't he learn any lessons from Gabriel?"},{"T":"301","3":"It's a gamble with no clear outcome ahead, a game that will only show the result when the box is open. Whether it's confidence or conceit lies in the ability of the one in control. At least for the moment, Vonnegut looks confident instead of conceited."},{"T":"301","3":"This 'experiment', which gives Roland mixed feelings, seems to confirm what Vonnegut thinks."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"So far, 14 groups of Scavengers have joined this 'experiment.'"},{"T":"301","3":"Each batch of humans introduced into the CPF to come into contact with 'Mother' has caused substantial stimulation to her body. This causes the 'creatures,' for lack of a better word, within it to mutate."},{"T":"301","3":"Roland can't find the words to describe the scene before him. Hetero-Creatures and Hetero-Plants show consistent variations at regular intervals, as if something is artificially controlling their boundaries."},{"T":"301","3":"Simultaneously, 'Mother' has become increasingly active as if the unknown 'creatures' within the incubator are beginning to achieve memory within the sea of chaos. They even seem to unconsciously respond to external stimuli."},{"T":"301","3":"Just like the subconscious movements of a baby in the womb, this is something even more terrifying to him than the Hetero-Creatures in Gabriel's deep pool."},{"T":"301","3":"As for the 'experiment'..."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"I gave them the options, and they all chose to go for the CPF. In the face of both opportunity and danger, they seized opportunity without any hesitation."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"'Mother' is hatching, and as it matures, the abnormalities in the tower will soon spill over to the outside."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"I can wait for the birth of a new life in 'Mother', but sooner or later, those in Babylonia will be able to sniff out where 'Mother' is."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"So when the time is ripe, you, as an outsider, will step in and make sure 'Mother' can hatch successfully."},{"T":"301","3":"Comms ring and interrupt Roland's musings."},{"T":"301","2":"Message from Cinderelik","3":"'Mother is ready.'"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"It's showtime!"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Beloved audience, the long-awaited performance is about to begin. Can I get a round of applause?"},{"T":"301","3":"Roland swings his chain blade in a theatrical gesture."},{"T":"301","3":"The Corrupted pass by senselessly. All he hears is the sound of a crow perched in a withered tree taking flight after being startled by the movement of his chain blade."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Fine... Guess I'll have to give myself a mechanical rose instead."},{"T":"301","3":"Roland shrugs then picks up the shotgun parts beside him and begins assembling it."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"This boring show has already gone on 14 times. I keep thinking it might have a different ending, but they always end up just killing each other or themselves. The stronger ones manage to make it out to the forest... But they'd be better off just staying in the CPF and waiting to die."},{"T":"301","3":"A mysterious dark cage, a group of helpless trapped animals, an imaginary goal\u2014so far everything was just rehashing a low-budget film."},{"T":"301","3":"Roland gets lost in thought for a moment."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Hah... Guess it's only normal. After all, how can you trust people other than yourself when you can't even protect yourself?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"After witnessing this series of tragedies, does 'Mother' really have 'emotions'?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"What will be the result of 'its' evolution?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"What will 'it' think of us then?"},{"T":"301","3":"...What would Luna think?"},{"T":"301","3":"Roland briefly stops assembling the shotgun as if seriously contemplating the question hovering in his mind."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"\u2026\u2026"},{"T":"301","3":"Click!\u2014The spring suddenly makes a sound. Roland shakes his head and holsters the fully-assembled shotgun at his waist."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Time to get to work."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"The area that has just been cleared is covered with bugs now. I can't let the 'actors' stay here."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"In the past... it was just a matter of snapping my fingers to get rid of these scrap metals. Now I got to get my hands dirty. It's really sad to be dependent on others."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Even the 'selection' has to be done in the most complicated and stupid way... It's like a disaster for people who value efficiency."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Shouldn't take too long, though. Should it?"}]
