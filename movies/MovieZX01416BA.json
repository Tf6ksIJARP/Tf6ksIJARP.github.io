You're not Derek? Who are you?"},{"T":"302","2":"(Explain)"},{"T":"301","2":"Amberia","3":"\u3010kuroname\u3011, commandant from Babylonia."},{"T":"301","2":"Amberia","3":"I know why you are here, but I decline your request."},{"T":"301","2":"Amberia","3":"I won't stop the bionics...

I'm going to open my eyes and escape from this place."},{"T":"302","2":"Are you not going berserk?","4":"If you promise not to hurt anyone else."},{"T":"301","2":"Amberia","3":"Berserk... You call this fear of mine, berserk?"},{"T":"301","2":"Amberia","3":"I'm just trying to protect myself! Protect myself from those people!"},{"T":"301","2":"Amberia","3":"Hurt others... No, I never wanted to hurt anyone. I just wanted the ones that hurt me gone..."},{"T":"301","2":"Amberia","3":"You'd do the same in my shoes. I'm going to eliminate the ARU and everything that stands in my way. That way, I won't be imprisoned in this ice cave ever again."},{"T":"301","2":"Amberia","3":"I don't want anyone to call me a monster ever again!"},{"T":"301","2":"Amberia","3":"So... As long as you have the code, \u3010kuroname\u3011, I will never let you leave this place!"},{"T":"301","3":"\u2014\u2014"},{"T":"301","2":"Amberia (Atiel)","3":"Ngh...

Wait, why is my frame so slow!"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Thank the commandant. Also, weren't you just in misery as well?"},{"T":"301","2":"Amberia (Atiel)","3":"Hmph... That was just pain caused by M.I.N.D. integration. Once it is complete, Amberia will no longer exist, and I can perfectly control this frame!"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Then you'll become the monster in Amberia's stead.
