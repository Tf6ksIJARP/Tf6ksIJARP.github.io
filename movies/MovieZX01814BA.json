[{"T":"301","2":"Troy","3":"Looks like the battle here was especially brutal, even the foundation is deformed."},{"T":"301","3":"After confirming that there are no signs of life up ahead, Troy puts down his scope and walks out of the corner of the ruins."},{"T":"301","2":"Troy","3":"Wanshi, everything checks out on my side. I'm going to head down the tilted foundation and investigate."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Alright... I've positioned myself in a vantage point nearby."},{"T":"301","2":"Troy","3":"Wow, that was fast."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"That just means I can kick up my feet sooner."},{"T":"301","3":"Troy checks Wanshi's coordinates on his panel, then looks up to see a sniper rifle nestled within a hole in the wall above. Wanshi leans up against the wall and yawns."},{"T":"301","2":"Troy","3":"You've even set up your weapon. NOW I can count on you..."},{"T":"301","3":"Troy leaps forward and arrives at a cluster of buildings under the deformed foundation."},{"T":"301","2":"Troy","3":"But you noticed it too, didn't you? The marker for the file we've been looking for is flashing in the ruins."},{"T":"301","2":"Troy","3":"We'll finish our mission once I collect it."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Copy that."},{"T":"301","2":"Troy","3":"Let me check the scan... Alright, I should be able to enter from here."},{"T":"301","3":"Two collapsed stone slabs on the left and right support each other, forming a space just big enough for one person to enter and exit. Troy kneels down under the stone slabs and steps into the dark ruins in front of him."},{"T":"301","3":"However, just as Troy wants to move on, he comes into contact with something hard."},{"T":"301","2":"Troy","3":"Huh? My panel isn't showing anything on the display."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Scusa, outsiders are not permitted to enter."},{"T":"301","2":"Troy","3":"Who's there?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Troy, get out of there!"},{"T":"301","3":"A strong shock interrupts Troy's conversation with Wanshi. The building ruins that Troy entered suddenly shake violently."},{"T":"301","3":"Rubble and steel bars collapse for the second time. Troy and debris fly out of the collapsed ruins and hit the opposite building, stirring up a cloud of smoke and dust."},{"T":"301","3":"A dark figure exits the collapsed ruins. The mechanical grinding of machine parts can be heard coming from his torso."},{"T":"301","3":"Wanshi's vision module can only detect an intricate machine and a head tightly bandaged as if out of punishment or atonement."},{"T":"301","3":"But Wanshi and Troy's panels pick up nothing on the scan. The Babylonian equipment is useless in identifying the figure."},{"T":"301","3":"No Corrupted response. No Construct response. Not ever a human response. The flashing lights on their scanners indicate that the equipment is operating normally."},{"T":"301","3":"The position where the figure stands is devoured by thick darkness, even light cannot escape. The moonlight and remaining light within the ruins does not reflect any color."},{"T":"301","2":"Troy","3":"(Clears throat) This is the first time... I've seen someone this strange."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Troy... Troy..."},{"T":"301","2":"Troy","3":"Wanshi... I'm okay. That thing... has what we need."},{"T":"301","3":"The dark figure inserts a chip into its chest, causing the mission icon to flash on their display panels."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Seems like we have our eyes on the same file."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Unfortunately, I cannot let you have it. I went through tremendous effort to unlock Gestalt's encrypted lock."},{"T":"301","2":"Troy","3":"Who... are you?"},{"T":"301","2":"Gear?","3":"Just an insignificant 'gear.' My job is to ensure that all operations run smoothly."},{"T":"301","3":"The dark figure replies and walks toward Troy who fell in the ruins. The gravel at its feet vibrates with each step like a pounding drum."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Step away from him."},{"T":"301","3":"Wanshi quickly rappels down as he empties his clip. Silver lights rain down on the shadow, only to be deflected in the air by blue lights."},{"T":"301","2":"Gear?","3":"Is that a threat?"},{"T":"301","2":"Gear?","3":"It seems that you can't simply die without pain."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Ngh... Troy, hold on."},{"T":"301","2":"Gear?","3":"Outsiders must be purged."}]
