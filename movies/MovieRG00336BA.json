[{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"What is this...!!!!"},{"T":"301","3":"Not only the King, everyone was shocked and stopped to look at the light."},{"T":"301","3":"The artifact and the Demon King merged together, turning into a blazing sphere, then transformed into a strange surface that resembled a portal."},{"T":"301","3":"From which a familiar person walked out."},{"T":"301","2":"Celica (?)","3":"Phew... It's been a while since I last appeared with a body."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"It really is her... Miss Celica..."},{"T":"301","3":"The artifact answered Liv's call, and turned the Demon King into Celica."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"But will it actually help to have Celica here..."},{"T":"301","3":"Lee was the first to respond, and his concern was actually everybody's. The artifact might be powerful, but what about Celica?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"If she's only a projection from Liv's M.I.N.D... There's no way that she can give us what we need."},{"T":"301","2":"Celica (?)","3":"C'mon, you heroes... Are you questioning the power of the Goddess? I'm only using the look of Celica!"},{"T":"302","2":"What Goddess?","4":"Aren't you the Demon King?"},{"T":"301","2":"Goddess","3":"Wait, did you just summon me, Goddess Celica, without knowing anything?"},{"T":"301","2":"Goddess","3":"The Demon King is now part of me.

Ohhhhhh!"},{"T":"301","2":"Goddess","3":"How many times have I told you not to call me Overlord!"},{"T":"301","3":"The King was the second to realize what happened. Unlike us, he immediately shouted out a name."},{"T":"301","3":"Only to be kicked on the wall before he could even finish."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"At least we don't have to worry about her power. Whether you are Celica, or the Goddess... Could you lend your power to us?"},{"T":"301","2":"Goddess","3":"Of course. I answered your call, so I'm on your side, heroes."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Please get rid of that King then!"},{"T":"301","2":"Goddess","3":"No, heroes, you are the one to finish him off."},{"T":"302","2":"Why?","4":"Just kick him a few more times, can't you?"},{"T":"301","2":"Goddess","3":"The Goddess is set to be the administrator of this game. I can do many things, but I can never kill any being in the game."},{"T":"301","2":"Goddess","3":"Actually, I cannot do much other than delaying him... Didn't you realize the King was not damaged at all?"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Um... So much efforts all wasted."},{"T":"301","2":"Goddess","3":"Not at all! Remember I said you were the one to finish him off?

Hey, is this a system feature...?"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Correct. We couldn't kill the King because that was a system setting. But right now, our main quest is to defeat the King."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"That means he is no longer invincible. This quest can now be 'completed.'"},{"T":"301","2":"King","3":"...Ugh, I, I'm not going to die here!"},{"T":"301","3":"Realizing the tide had turned, the King fled further into the Demon King's Castle.
