Not a ripple of emotion nor disturbance can be seen, but they do emit a certain warmth. It reminds you of a dew-touched morning in late spring, calm and unbroken."},{"T":"302","2":"(Kinda makes me wanna chuckle.)","4":"Heh."},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"What are you laughing at?"},{"T":"302","2":"Just how sudden all this is."},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"How sudden this is?"},{"T":"302","2":"Like what's happening now."},{"T":"302","2":"It's like those games that Kamui plays..."},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"I don't get it."},{"T":"302","2":"This Ferris Wheel..."},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"...?"},{"T":"301","3":"Luna really does not seem to get it."},{"T":"302","2":"Ferris Wheels don't look like this.","4":"You're riding a roundabout."},{"T":"302","2":"Ferris Wheels and roundabouts are different."},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"Is that so...?"},{"T":"301","3":"A light shade of redness seems to have surfaced on Luna's face."},{"T":"302","2":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"All of a sudden, the atmosphere takes an awkward turn."},{"T":"301","2":"Luna","3":"I've never been on a Ferris Wheel before...
