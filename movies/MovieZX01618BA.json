Can't run anymore?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"There's nowhere else to run. The Corrupted are swarming from behind. You can't take them out alone."},{"T":"301","3":"He grabs the boy's neck to force him to look back."},{"T":"301","3":"Even though the Corrupted projections have been destroyed, the young Construct still continues to look toward the other end of the street in anguish and rage."},{"T":"301","3":"It appears that, while standing there, he must have a seen a dire situation with many Corrupted blocking their way out."},{"T":"301","2":"Young Construct","3":"Let... me... go..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"You're too weak now. It wouldn't be wise to resist."},{"T":"301","2":"Young Construct","3":"I... don't know... what... you're... talking about..."},{"T":"301","3":"The pressure from his neck suddenly increases. His consciousness and voice slowly fade."},{"T":"301","2":"Young Construct","3":"Rgh... Argh..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Hurts, doesn't it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Whether it be humans or Constructs... Life without 'ascension' is so fragile."},{"T":"301","2":"Young Construct","3":"Let... Let me go..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Oh? Why do you still insist on resisting? Let me see the answer in your M.I.N.D."},{"T":"301","3":"A red current flows through Roland's arm and the hand that is grabbing the boy's neck, and surges into his entire body in an instant."},{"T":"301","3":"As the corruption continues to rise, Roland is able to easily uncover the data within the boy's M.I.N.D."},{"T":"301","2":"Young Construct","3":"You\u2014"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Relax. If you're not careful, I'll tear your M.I.N.D. to pieces."},{"T":"301","2":"Young Construct","3":"No... Don't..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"...I see. You were sold by your mother... Ah, yet another orphan."},{"T":"301","2":"Young Construct","3":"...What?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"I've seen many others like you\u2014all abandoned. They will be 'ascended,' then saved from their sea of suffering."},{"T":"301","2":"Young Construct","3":"I... don't need saving!"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"It seems that you've been misguided by what you believe is correct."},{"T":"301","2":"Young Construct","3":"You\u2014!"},{"T":"301","3":"Even though Roland's words and corruption have filled the boy with misery, the young Construct continues to struggle in resistance."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"You heard that she came here with other scavengers. Is that not why you applied to conduct a mission here?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Are you using this as a way to find your family? But your memories of her were from so long ago. Even if you see her now, you might not even recognize her."},{"T":"301","2":"Young Construct","3":"...Mind your own... business..."},{"T":"301","3":"Hearing the boy's response, Roland shows an unsurprising expression of contempt, then throws the boy into the collapsed ruins. Smiling, he slowly walks toward him."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"What a pity. After becoming a Construct, your predecessor who took care of you was rebooted after being seriously injured. She not only lost her memory data, but was also transferred out of here."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"You are powerless in protecting her. That's why you lost. Without her, the other members will only belittle you. Isn't that right?"},{"T":"301","3":"The young Construct clenches his teeth tightly and struggles as the corruption continues to take hold."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"You have nothing. However, it is because you have nothing, that I can give you everything\u2014on behalf of the Ascendants."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Why protect a group of people who beat you down? Why bother transporting supplies to people who don't respect you at all?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Because you are too weak. If you have the power of an Ascendant, no one will dare to look down on you again. Your beloved predecessor wouldn't have forgotten everything from being injured so badly."},{"T":"301","2":"Young Construct","3":"The power of... an Ascendant?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Yes. Become an Ascendant\u2014your hatred is your greatest gift."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"With your power as an Ascendant, you can wave the blade of revenge against the people you hate."},{"T":"301","2":"Young Construct","3":"Can I... really?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Of course."},{"T":"301","2":"Young Construct","3":"...How will you do that?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Just make it there alive."},{"T":"301","3":"Roland grasps the young Construct's hand and gives him coordinates."},{"T":"301","2":"Young Construct","3":"Heh... With this amount of corruption... I'm afraid..."},{"T":"301","3":"Roland leans down, whispers something into the boy's ear, and pats him on the shoulder. Suddenly, the deadly red current subsides significantly."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Do as I say."},{"T":"301","3":"The young Construct stands there, looking at the holo-map in hesitation."},{"T":"301","3":"Roland leisurely walks away from the boy, as if appreciating the surrounding destruction. Suddenly, a notification sounds on his comms."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Yes? No problem. I just secured one. Where are you?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"...Looks like I have to help you fill more vacancies."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"No matter. Those that are capable should be left to bear the burden. That's why the Ascendants around Miss Luna come and go, yet I remain."},{"T":"301","3":"After terminating the call, Roland's projection smiles and walks away."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Next... I guess I should continue looking for 'seeds,' instead of letting those unreliable Ascendant recruits do it."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Did he say... Ascendant recruits?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Well, it was recorded a long time ago. And I doubt that he was talking to the ones we're familiar with that tone."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"...But what did he mean by 'come and go'?"},{"T":"301","3":"Thinking about what Roland said, you shift your gaze back at the boy standing still."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"I can see the general direction on his holo-screen."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"But it only shows this area... If only he had switched to navigation overview."},{"T":"301","3":"But the boy does not switch to the navigation overview. Instead, he just lowers his hand and walks in the direction indicated on the map."},{"T":"302","2":"At least we have a general direction."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Let's go that way first."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"I don't know what happened to the boy."},{"T":"302","2":"If only we could see his record again."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Yeah, I'll be looking out, too."},{"T":"302","2":"Are you worried about him?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"I can't help but pity him..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"But I also understand that there are countless teams like his."},{"T":"302","2":"Liv..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"Liv puts her hand on her chest and clutches her fist."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"In this world, life and death are a common sight. But I thought I was used to it..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"It's good that you're not used to it. Life is precious."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"That's why people choose to hurt and kill one another just to stay alive. But... this only makes matters worse."},{"T":"302","2":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"As Liv said, everyone has witnessed many similar tragedies along the way."},{"T":"301","3":"In order to live a better life, protect those important to them, or compete for military accolades, people bully the weak, plunder resources, and take lives."},{"T":"301","3":"And they have long reduced qualities like kindness from strength to weakness."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"However, I still want to believe that there are many other teams with deep bonds like us..."},{"T":"301","3":"Liv's voice is so low that she does not sound convinced."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"There are teams with deep bonds, but this will bring new problems."},{"T":"301","3":"Hearing this, Liv lowers her head in sadness."},{"T":"302","2":"Like... Tifa?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Yeah... I heard that some Constructs wiped their memory in order to prevent something extreme from happening like what happened to Tifa."},{"T":"302","2":"They wiped their memory?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Yeah... They chose to rid themselves of the tortuous memories of fallen comrades ..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"In the years of treating the wounded, I have seen a lot of such things..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"They abandoned their memories in order to live?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"In order to survive, we have to decide what to accept, as difficult to bear as they are... That's the price."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...The price."},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia looks at her hand, lost in contemplation."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Back then, I was prepared to lose my memories because there were more things I couldn't lose. So, this is the price I paid."},{"T":"302","2":"You had more things to lose?"},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia raises her head and smiles."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Didn't we make a promise? The four Gray Ravens will stay together forever."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"So, I need to return to the battlefield. I need to be by your side."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"You've changed, Lucia."},{"T":"302","2":"Yeah."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"How so?"},{"T":"301","3":"In the past, Lucia was like a sharp blade willing to pay any price for a mission. But now, there is a gentleness to her, as if she has found a sheath for her sharp edges."},{"T":"302","2":"(Tell her)"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"A blade belongs in a sheath... For me, the Gray Ravens and the commandant have indeed become where I belong."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"I'm happy to be with you, too. Gray Raven is the one and only home to us all."},{"T":"301","3":"Although Lee does not say anything, the corners of his mouth raise into a faint smile."},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia stands next to the three of you. Although her gestures are still very similar to Lotus and Dawn from before, she shows a sign of gentleness."},{"T":"301","3":"As if aware of your silence, Lucia walks over."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"What is it, Commandant?"},{"T":"302","2":"You seem..."},{"T":"302","2":"More gentle than before..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"That's because this promise is what I want to treasure and protect. That is why I'll no longer treat myself only as a weapon."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"It doesn't mean that I will lose my edge. Now that I have something to protect, I will not stop fighting, like a sharpened blade in the sheath."},{"T":"302","2":"Don't overwork yourself.","4":"Still, I can't accept..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Well, it seems that I'm lucky. Not only did I survive, but so did my precious memories. They are safe within my M.I.N.D."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Even though I need to refamiliarize myself with my memories... It's a very... insignificant price compared to leaving you and everyone else, Commandant."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Can't accept what?"},{"T":"302","2":"The fact that I couldn't protect you back then.","4":"It's like you've become a completely different person."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Then..."},{"T":"301","3":"She hangs her head, covering her eyes with her hair and obscuring her expression."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Perhaps, a weapon is still more convenient for the commandant."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...Once I refamiliarize myself with my memories\u2014the smoke and flames of war\u2014I will be able to return to being the Lucia you are familiar with."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"So... Before that happens, will you wait for me?"},{"T":"302","2":"Of course.","4":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...Thank you."},{"T":"301","3":"Sighing in relief, she raises her head and her expression returns to normal."},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia hangs her head and waits for an answer in silence. After some time, she raises her head again and looks at the street in front of her with a lonely expression."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Let's go, Commandant."},{"T":"302","2":"Lucia."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Hm?"},{"T":"302","2":"I will change it for the better.","4":"This fight will come to an end."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Yes, I believe you."},{"T":"301","3":"She smiles bitterly, but her eyes shine with hope and conviction. Standing at the base of what appears to be a mountainous feat, she is like a mountaineer determined to climb the rugged path and reach the distant peak."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Commander, I believe that this fight will come to an end, too. Even when that day comes, the four Gray Ravens will always be together."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Indeed. I don't ever want to go through the trouble of changing teams."},{"T":"302","2":"Really?","4":"I heard it was quick and easy."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Shut up."},{"T":"301","3":"Even though he snaps at you, the corners of his mouth turn into a faint smile."},{"T":"302","2":"Let's go."},{"T":"302","2":"Let's change the course of this fight."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Roger! Gray Ravens, let's go!"}]
