And Miss Bianca... Your frame..."},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"I only changed into a frame that's more suitable for this situation, do not be alarmed."},{"T":"302","2":"Are you here to help?","4":"Where's Lee?"},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"Your commands, please, Commandant of Gray Raven."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Sorry, we were deployed in different directions and didn't have time to meet up, but I was able to sense Lee's signal all this time, so he should be fine."},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"...So you're the one Babylonia sent to make the deal?"},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"I'd like to welcome you if I could, but as you can see, you came at a rather inconvenient timing."},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"I noticed, looks like I've entered at the wrong time... You were saying? Don't mind me, please continue."},{"T":"301","2":"Sophia","3":"Before that... Can I ask a question?"},{"T":"301","2":"Sophia","3":"Did Babylonia accept our deal?"},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"That's..."},{"T":"301","3":"Bianca pauses and glances at the crowd, and nods her head."},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"Babylonia has agreed to Akdilek's terms."},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"...But I do not think moving to Babylonia is such a joyous thing."},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"You."},{"T":"301","3":"Bianca meets Sophia's shimmering gaze, as if she had read the girl's mind."},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"You should be able to suggest something better."},{"T":"301","2":"Sophia","3":"Suggest something better...

She's one of us so she understands our situation!"},{"T":"301","2":"Aristocrat A","3":"We should just settle for going to Babylonia, and not make some gibberish deal...

She's saved me before too..."},{"T":"301","2":"Aristocrat B","3":"Now that I think about it, the Ascendants never guaranteed to make us Ascendants... And they look like they're up to no good..."},{"T":"301","2":"Aristocrat A","3":"Walking on Earth again with our own power...

She's a Construct, maybe she really is that strong..."},{"T":"301","2":"Ashlar","3":"Preposterous, both the aristocrats and commoners..."},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"Sophia, do you still remember our conversation from before? What should you do to ensure a larger profit when making a deal?"},{"T":"301","2":"Sophia","3":"...Choose the option with a higher risk."},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"And that, is the final answer from me and my fellow merchants."},{"T":"302","2":"Let's take the first step then.","4":"Then let's go get the merchandise."},{"T":"301","2":"Sophia","3":"...Okay!"},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"Looks like a decision has been made.
