[{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Is this some kind of a joke?!"},{"T":"301","3":"A loud noise comes out of the laboratory, something other than an explosion, for once. It startles Ayla, who is returning to get more couplets."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"W-what's happening?"},{"T":"301","3":"Ayla carefully opens the door and finds quite a few people inside. Aside from Asimov and Allen, Presiden Hassen and Commander Nikola are also present."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"Chairman! And why is Commander Nikola here as well..."},{"T":"301","2":"Allen","3":"How do I put it... I messed up. Commander Nikola was there when I handed in the application to President Hassen, and he immediately came this way after knowing what we've been up to."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"We're so done..."},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola takes a deep breath, trying to contain his anger."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Wasting the precious resources from the Science Council to make these ridiculous things... Why would any of you think that we'll allow it?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Allen","3":"Speaking for the WGAA, hosting activities to promote human civilization and culture is what we do. I don't see what's wrong with it."},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola shakes his head, disappointed as if he has wasted his time."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"You're on the Council, you should've known your priorities. This isn't time for festivities."},{"T":"301","2":"Allen","3":"I don't think it's an either-or situation."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Alright. I'm sure that Asimov has his considerations when he accepts this job on behalf of the Science Council."},{"T":"301","3":"Facing Hassen's questions, Asimov nods as he continues deciphering the couplets on the floor."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Commander Nikola, do you remember approving the CUB project at the Council a while ago?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Of course! So why are you abandoning that project to do arts and crafts with the WGAA?"},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"These couplets are written by the AI system of the CUB used in previous tests..."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Huh, isn't that interesting, Nikola?"},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola does not appear to find it interesting."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Therefore, the Science Council has deemed it necessary to analyze and restore these couplets to better calibrate the AI system."},{"T":"301","2":"Allen","3":"Just so happens, we also want to deliver the couplets to different squads and departments to lift their spirits during Lunar New Year."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Even so, I still don't agree to waste our time on this matter."},{"T":"301","3":"As the tension mounts, a smiling young man walks out from a corner to Nikola's side."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"Commander, I have a question for Asimov, if you don't mind?"},{"T":"301","3":"Despite looking impatient, Nikola signals Murray to ask his question with a look."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"Although I don't know how this... CUB works, but from what I understand, many Construct squads are not willing to use them currently."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"You're right. Celica did a survey earlier, and many Constructs were worried about the stability of their M.I.N.D.s when connecting directly to its AI system..."},{"T":"301","3":"Catching Murray's intent, Ayla quickly follows."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"Therefore, if there's a function that let people understand the CUBs more, it'll make the squad members trust them more."},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola picks up one of the couplets and takes a look."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"...With this? Nevermind. You'll assess how useful this activity is\u2014but only on the basis that other R&D projects and missions won't be affected."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Right, in that case, let's also put these couplets up outside the Council and the Commander's room."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Are you serious..."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Haha, why not? If we set an example to embrace new things, I'm certain the other squads will follow suit."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"With Nikola's tacit approval, Ayla immediately takes out the couplets she prepared with a grin."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"Leave the decorating to WGAA! We're efficient, and it won't interrupt your work at all!"},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"...You better be."},{"T":"301","3":"With their approval, Ayla leaves the room as quickly as she can, as if staying for another second would risk Nikola going back on his words."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"What a mess..."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Let it go. It's the New Year\u2014the young people should move around more... Now, the rest of us still have some things to take care of."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"True. We've wasted too much time here. There is still plenty to discuss and decide for next year's battle plan."},{"T":"301","3":"Hassen and Nikola leave the laboratory first, followed by Murray, who says goodbye to Asimov and Allen with a smile."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"I should also go, then. Keep up with your work, gentlemen!"},{"T":"301","2":"Allen","3":"I guess I should thank you for your help. And... Happy New Year."},{"T":"301","3":"Murray looks a little surprised by Allen's gratitude, but he quickly composes himself."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"Of course. Happy New Year to you as well."},{"T":"301","3":"Murray gives them a slight bow before turning around and walking out of the room after Hassen and Nikola. He is smiling, albeit peculiarly."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"(\u2014Indeed, there's much to happen this year. I've got to be prepared.)"}]
