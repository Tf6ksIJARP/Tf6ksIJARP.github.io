[{"T":"301","3":"Huainan enters his room to find Changyu sitting cross-legged by his bed. A map covered in scratches and marks is laid flat on the table, its folds smoothed out by a pencil-chewing Changyu, buried in thought."},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"Hey, what's up?"},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"What took you so long? And where have you been lately?"},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"...Forget it. Check this out first."},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"What is it\u2014is that the plan of the Nighter?"},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"Drawn by yours truly! I've marked every inch of the boat that I could set foot on, so this should be pretty accurate."},{"T":"301","3":"Changyu takes his pencil and circles the spot marked 'Trade Fair,' then continues drawing along a series of crooked passageways all across the deck until it reaches the edge of the Nighter."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"This is my next target."},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"The Trade Fair?"},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"Think bigger\u2014Akdilek."},{"T":"301","3":"Changyu and Huainan follow their guide to the dimly lit laboratory underground."},{"T":"301","3":"Shabby as the place may be, the constant humming from the equipment and the rows of test tubes filled with colorful liquids have made this already tiny space uncomfortably oppressive."},{"T":"301","2":"Guide","3":"It's up ahead. You can talk to the doctor yourself."},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"Thanks."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"Didn't think you'd know a place like this..."},{"T":"301","3":"Changyu takes stock of the strange surroundings and mutters to Huainan."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"And I thought you were going to stop me."},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"Why Akdilek?"},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"For justice."},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"Bullshit."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"Fine, I just wanted to know how you'd react. You've got a history with them, don't you?"},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"...I'm not ready to talk about myself."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"That's alright. I wasn't probing."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"But I'm serious about Adeilek. I've done some digging\u2014they're looking for live bodies on the boat, those that can be refitted into Constructs. I think I can make a score from it."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"And now's your chance to stop me."},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"Will it work?"},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"Of course!"},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"We are partners!"},{"T":"301","3":"Changyu's eyes glinted with fervency and sincerity."},{"T":"301","3":"Huainan saw himself reflected in them. He paused for a moment, then pushed his hair aside, revealing a horrendous scar on his neck."},{"T":"301","3":"Even concealed behind his collar, the swollen crimson mark on his neck was still clearly visible. It wound and weaved on Huainan's skin, crawling and slithering."},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"This is my quarrel with Akdilek."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"...?!"},{"T":"301","3":"Huainan straightened his coat and hid the awful scar."},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"I'm not stopping you."},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"But I need to know where your information's coming from. Can you trust them?"},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"Their reputation precedes them in the black market. Spend a little money and grease some wheels, and nothing's hidden under the sun."},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"Meddling right under their noses, huh?"},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"Here's my plan\u2014I'll pretend to be one of the merchandise, and after Akdilek purchases this remarkable body, I'll escape with their money and leave them empty-handed."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"Just trust me."},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"Akdilek wants bodies that are suited to be Constructs. Do you even fit the requirement? Or are you forging your data?"},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"The secret to a well-planned scheme is to not plan everything. You have to follow the ebb and flow of the plot, manipulating it the way you do water, guiding it just enough so it flows where you want it."},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"What are you... Is this your third lesson?"},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"What? No! The third lesson is 'don't trust strangers.' But\u2014you must trust your partner unequivocally."},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"...I know a place. They can check if your body's suitable to be refitted."},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"Doctors like that are a dime a dozen on the black market. I happen to know one who'll do anything for the right price."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"So you..."},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"Let's go."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"Huh?"},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"I never said I'm sitting this one out."},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"Maybe I can tell you something about me after this."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"...Okay!"},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"Are you listening? Changyu?"},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"What is it? I wasn't paying attention."},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"...Sigh. Focus this time."},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"Now, you should be familiar with our damn collars. Everyone on this boat has one around their neck."},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"It serves two functions. First of all, it's a way to remotely control us. Even if it's only indirectly, the two primary commands coded in the collar mean we can't leave the Nighter, and we can't harm it."},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"It's also our ID. The collars on this boat have records of all bodies onboard the Nighter\u2014living, Construct, mechanoid."},{"T":"301","3":"Changyu traces the collar on his neck. Of course he knows of it, but he has never really considered what its existence means."},{"T":"301","3":"He has lived the same routine on this boat as far as he can recall, for... three months, a year\u2014or three? He has no recollection, and he can never quite put his finger on it. Everything just... happened."},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"One human, one set of corresponding data. Including that person's Tantalum-193 affinity."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"Tantalum-193 affinity?"},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"Only those with high enough Tantalum-193 affinity can be refitted into Constructs."},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"Assuming somewhere on this boat is a person with the desired Tantalum-193 affinity, someone who's not associated with the 'official merchandise' from the Kowloong Crew\u2014"},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"That's who Akdilek is after. That's the leverage we need."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"So, we have to figure out if we are merchandise-material to begin with..."},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"That's right. It'll be so much easier if we can just be a part of the wares on display. But if we can't do that, we can still get what we're after here."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"How come you know all of this so well?"},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"The worst thing we can face on this boat is uncertainty, don't you think?"},{"T":"301","2":"Black Market Doctor","3":"Are you the one?"},{"T":"301","3":"The two young men are interrupted by the approaching surgeon. His face may be concealed by a mask, but it is clear that his eyes are keenly examining Changyu."},{"T":"301","2":"Black Market Doctor","3":"Follow me."},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"They're doing our examinations simultaneously to save time. You can head in first. Mine's also about to start."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"...I'll see you later."}]
