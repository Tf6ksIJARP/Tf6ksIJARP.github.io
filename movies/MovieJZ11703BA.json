[{"T":"301","3":"In the morning, over a dozen Kurono troops dressed in new uniforms line up outside of their tents\u2014troops recently reborn as Constructs. A new spark for humanity's future."},{"T":"301","3":"A few weeks after Luna's corruption and Collins' arrival, the Kurono Research Lab has had a series of successful experiments, even transforming a number of Collin's troops into Constructs."},{"T":"301","3":"Their hearts are filled with trepidation. After all, they are merely children at this point, having no idea what the ramifications of being a Construct are."},{"T":"301","3":"Unlike the stiff recruits, Collins is sitting casually on a rock, filled with indifference."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Good morning, children. Starting today, I shall be in charge of your field training."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Where is the applause? Nikola, dear boy, how did you raise them?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola closes his eyes, reluctant to answer him."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Come on, don't leave me hanging."},{"T":"301","3":"The soldiers exchange glances, then gradually join in applause. A few soldiers laughed, thinking Collins is joking, while another girl with an annoyed look refrains from clapping."},{"T":"301","2":"Girl Construct","3":"Hmph... What's so great about an ol' geezer like you?"},{"T":"301","3":"Rather than getting angry, Collins laughs."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Hahaha! You're right, Letty girl. There's nothing great about this ol' geezer."},{"T":"301","3":"Letty is taken aback hearing him say her name so casually."},{"T":"301","2":"Letty","3":"How... how do you know my name?"},{"T":"301","3":"Collins ignores her and stands up from the rock, addressing all of the new recruits."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"I don't know what Nikola has told you, but no matter who you were yesterday, whether you were suckling a pacifier or wearing diapers, from today onward you are no longer the protected. You aren't even human anymore..."},{"T":"301","3":"Collins grins as he paces among the recruit, looking at the expression on each of their faces."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"You will be fighting against monsters... as monsters!"},{"T":"301","3":"Collins continues to smile facetiously, but none of the recruits dare to smile."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Of course, whether it be humans or monsters, there is trash and then there are the elites."},{"T":"301","3":"Collins stops in front of Letty, intentionally or not, and stares at her firmly."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Elite monsters are capable of entering Babylonia. Whereas trash will be thrown in the dump."},{"T":"301","2":"Letty","3":"Hey... Geezer... What are you gettin' at!"},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Starting today, I will re-evaluate your combat ability and Inver-Device affinity. If you don't make the cut, you'll be discarded. No one's going to be wiping your asses anymore."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"No hand-holding, no comfort from Mommy, but discarded! You'll be thrown into the toilet and flushed\u2014VOILA! Got it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Researcher","3":"But even if they lack combat ability, they are still invaluable in battle. We should..."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Soldiers that are useless in training are also useless on the battlefield. The weak will only fill the battlefield with more Corrupted."},{"T":"301","3":"Collins cocks his head at the researcher in surprise, as if he's a freak of nature."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Who will be responsible for sending them to their goddamn graves then? Me or you?"},{"T":"301","3":"The researcher musters up a retort but is stopped by Nikola."},{"T":"301","3":"A soldier charges through the crowd toward Collins\u2014Letty, the girl from before."},{"T":"301","2":"Letty","3":"You've got to be joking! I only risked my life to do this godforsaken surgery so I could go to Babylonia!"},{"T":"301","2":"Letty","3":"I don't wanna stay in this hellhole to be trained and tested... Send me to Babylonia, NOW!"},{"T":"301","3":"Collins smiles as he waits for her to finish and nods."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"You're right. This is indeed a hellhole. And this ol' geezer doesn't want to waste his time playing games with you."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"You know, I don't have a problem with loudmouths such as you, but you'd better not be all bark and no bite. Otherwise..."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"...You're nothing but a silly little lapdog."},{"T":"301","3":"Letty's face flushes with anger as she throws a punch at Collins."},{"T":"301","3":"Collins dodges the punch with surprising agility and grabs her by the wrist with ease."},{"T":"301","2":"Letty","3":"Let me go!"},{"T":"301","3":"Letty tries to shake her wrist free. Theoretically speaking, her strength as a Construct should have made it easy for her to overpower Collins."},{"T":"301","3":"But right as she exerts herself, Collins lets go, causing her to lose balance as she is still unaccustomed to her newfound strength. Collins then swipes across her leg with a kick, and she falls to the ground."},{"T":"301","2":"Letty","3":"I'm gonna kill you!"},{"T":"301","3":"She tries to rally another attack, only to be met with Collin's gun pointing at her chest."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Like I said, I don't have anything against loudmouths like you. But if you want to talk big, win approval, or even kill me\u2014you should at least put your money where your mouth is..."},{"T":"301","3":"Collins reaches a hand into his sleeve, pulls out a pocket knife and throws it toward Letty."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Not only are you weak and stupid, but more importantly, you don't want even a shred of discipline."},{"T":"301","3":"Collins takes out a comically small notebook and reads from his notes."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"According to reports, you often abstain from training. Well, where on earth do you go?"},{"T":"301","2":"Letty","3":"H-how would I rremember?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Great, looks like your memory isn't much of anything either... No worries, I'll help you refresh it."},{"T":"301","3":"Collins turns a page and acts surprised."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"During the many times you've skipped out on training, you've either gone rummaging through the remains of casualties or breaking into civilian settlements to steal their property. Is that right?"},{"T":"301","3":"Rather than denying it, Letty appears to even be a little proud."},{"T":"301","2":"Letty","3":"So what? I'm protecting them with my life. What's wrong with taking a little off the top!"},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Constructs have no use for remuneration... You did it entirely out of greed and stupidity. You've always been quite the rotten apple."},{"T":"301","3":"Collins disengages the gun's safety and points it back at Letty."},{"T":"301","2":"Letty","3":"Hey, hey... Geezer, you aren't really going to shoot me... Are you?"},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"As a monster, you're nothing but trash. As a human, you're nothing but vermin. What other value does your life have?"},{"T":"301","3":"Collin smiles and waves at Letty."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Bye!"},{"T":"301","3":"After several gunshots, silence falls upon the training ground."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Ugh... Another waste of my bullets, damn it. So, Nikola, my dear boy, turns out these scavengers and thugs lack character and conscience. You people are just wasting your time with these kids."},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola looks at Letty with a blank face."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"It's normal to do anything to survive. Plenty of these people have the potential to become elite soldiers."},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola once again thinks about the two sisters who have become Constructs... He always has a hunch that if they can 'survive' together, they have the potential to become the so-called... spark that guards humanity's last hope."},{"T":"301","3":"Collins rubs his chin noncommittally but seems to lose interest in an instant."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"Perhaps, dear boy. Looking at it that way, there might just be a diamond in the rough. Report to me if you find one, and I shall recommend them for a promotion. As for the trash..."},{"T":"301","3":"As Collins glances at Letty on the ground, the operation leader off to the side immediately stands at attention."},{"T":"301","2":"Operation Leader","3":"Sir, I'll take the 'trash' to the disposal plant."},{"T":"301","2":"Collins","3":"This guy... when did he become so smart? Honestly, it's repulsive."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"..."}]
