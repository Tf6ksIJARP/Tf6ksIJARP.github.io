She must be the Rosetta that the old man is calling."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Grandpa Pfaff?"},{"T":"301","2":"Pfaff","3":"I'll leave this fella to you.

The teary and hopeless look in its eyes causes her to wince."},{"T":"301","3":"But she knows that her grandfather would never allow her to show any sign of weakness.
