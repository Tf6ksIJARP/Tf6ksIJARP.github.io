His suit has dirt on it, but he does not have time to clean it."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"Mr. Guide, you can use my handkerchief if you don't mind."},{"T":"301","2":"Tour Guide","3":"Th-thank you."},{"T":"301","2":"Terminal","3":"Hey! What's wrong with you?! Why are you at some random stupid place again?!"},{"T":"301","3":"The guide is about to take Pulao's handkerchief, but his terminal suddenly starts to talk, shocking him greatly."},{"T":"301","3":"His hands are juggling like a circus performer. Finally, he manages to catch the handkerchief before it drops to the ground."},{"T":"301","2":"Tour Guide","3":"Phew..."},{"T":"301","3":"He wipes some cold sweat off his forehead and takes out the terminal."},{"T":"301","2":"Terminal","3":"You really are a genius."},{"T":"301","2":"Terminal","3":"As a tour guide, the last thing you do is take the client the wrong way. Across the entire company, our team is the only one that always gets a C in the KPI, and you are the reason why."},{"T":"301","2":"Terminal","3":"You are a disgrace!"},{"T":"301","2":"Tour Guide","3":"But our KPI plummeted because you used the funds elsewhere..."},{"T":"301","2":"Terminal","3":"What?"},{"T":"301","2":"Tour Guide","3":"No, nothing. You are right, leader. It's all my fault. I promise I'll correct my mistake."},{"T":"301","3":"The terminal's video function is not enabled, but the tour guide is still bowing and nodding as he holds it."},{"T":"301","2":"Terminal","3":"I don't care about your promise. You say the same thing every time, but never fail to disappoint me."},{"T":"301","2":"Terminal","3":"You don't have to come tomorrow."},{"T":"301","2":"Tour Guide","3":"Please, don't!"},{"T":"301","2":"Tour Guide","3":"I'm the only breadwinner in the family.

I'll never be able to find another job..."},{"T":"301","2":"Terminal","3":"You want a chance? Who's going to give me a chance?"},{"T":"301","2":"Terminal","3":"You've been in the industry for over ten years. Still, you take the clients to the wrong way multiple times every month. I'm losing all my hair handling their complaints."},{"T":"301","2":"Terminal","3":"Did you give my hair a chance?"},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"Um...

Please don't file another complaint..."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"Oh, no, I'm not 'honored' at all.

He covers his mouth and continues to listen to their conversation."},{"T":"301","2":"Terminal","3":"Are you saying that he didn't take you to the wrong way this time?"},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"He didn't. Actually, Mr. Guide showed me lots of great views along the way, many of which I have never seen in the town! I saw rushing streams, steep valleys and dense jungles. They are so beautiful!"},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"Mr. Guide did his job and went above and beyond. Instead of criticizing him, you should give him well-deserved praise."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"I'd like to give him a five-star rating!"},{"T":"301","2":"Terminal","3":"Um..."},{"T":"301","2":"Terminal","3":"Fine, if the client says so, I can let you walk this time."},{"T":"301","2":"Tour Guide","3":"Thank you so much..."},{"T":"301","3":"The tour guide keeps thanking his leader until the conversation is hung up. After quite a while, he finally stands up and returns Pulao's handkerchief with both hands."},{"T":"301","2":"Tour Guide","3":"Much appreciated. I don't know what I would do without you."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"Hehe, you are welcome."},{"T":"301","2":"Tour Guide","3":"Sorry... I didn't take you to the Big Fish after all."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"Don't worry. One of my friends used to say, 'keep asking and you'll find your way.' We just need to ask around."},{"T":"301","2":"Tour Guide","3":"That's true... Oh, it's getting late."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"You should go pick up your kid. You have already helped me to get out of the most dangerous area. I can walk the rest on my own."},{"T":"301","2":"Tour Guide","3":"Um..."},{"T":"301","3":"The tour guide opens his mouth but nothing comes out. When Pulao packs her bag and waves her hand to say goodbye, he suddenly stops her."},{"T":"301","2":"Tour Guide","3":"Wait a sec, girl."},{"T":"301","2":"Tour Guide","3":"You said you were looking for Big Fish's tears. But you don't have any containers with you."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"You're right!"},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"I left in a rush and completely forgot about it."},{"T":"301","3":"The tour guide takes out a pink water bottle with lovely bunny stickers on it."},{"T":"301","2":"Tour Guide","3":"This was my daughter's old bottle. When she grew up, she thought it was too childish and no longer used it."},{"T":"301","2":"Tour Guide","3":"It's just the right size for Big Fish's tears."},{"T":"301","2":"Tour Guide","3":"Just take it as a token of appreciation."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"C-can I?"},{"T":"301","2":"Tour Guide","3":"Of course. I'll ask my friends about the Big Fish when I go back. Once I hear something, I'll send it to your terminal."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"Wow! Thanks, Mr. Guide!"},{"T":"301","2":"Tour Guide","3":"Don't thank me. This is nothing compared to how much you have helped me to keep my job."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"Your job is really important to you, it seems."},{"T":"301","2":"Tour Guide","3":"Of course. It means the world to someone my age."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"Have you ever thought about changing to another job, or starting your own business?"},{"T":"301","2":"Tour Guide","3":"I can't. Once you grow old, finding a job gets very difficult."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"But I heard many good things about running a stall."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"Why don't you start a shop near your daughter's school? It's less hectic, and you get to spend more time with her."},{"T":"301","2":"Tour Guide","3":"I'm never a business person."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"But I think the kids will love your passion and kindness!"},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"At least you never have to worry about not having enough customers!"},{"T":"301","2":"Tour Guide","3":"Hmm... You have a point."},{"T":"301","2":"Tour Guide","3":"Thank you, I'll think about it! Hope you can find Big Fish too."}]
