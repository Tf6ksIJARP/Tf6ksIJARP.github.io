Why do you know so much about the game, Wanshi?"},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"A long time ago... There was a sick kid who would just stay in bed all day and refuse treatment.

How's that possible?"},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Does that mean... the commandant's 'confined treatment' is just an excuse?"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"You know about that?"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"No wonder you haven't gotten much sleep recently."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"I just wanted to help treat \u3010kuroname\u3011.
