Do you know why he looks so angry in the projection?"},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Um... No idea."},{"T":"301","2":"Thompson","3":"Because I failed to keep my promise."},{"T":"301","2":"Thompson","3":"The children are growing up full of spirits even though the war outside is fierce."},{"T":"301","2":"Thompson","3":"The coaching center organized a ball game and I promised him that I'd go watch it."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Sounds like something to be happy about."},{"T":"301","2":"Thompson","3":"But it turned out I was still out on the surface when the match happened."},{"T":"301","2":"Thompson","3":"After I went back, all my equipment, my bed, and everything I owned were packed and thrown out of my house."},{"T":"301","2":"Thompson","3":"They wouldn't let me in, you know.

You aren't willing to talk to others when you're upset."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"I..."},{"T":"301","2":"Thompson","3":"Though it was part of my fault, I didn't regret it."},{"T":"301","2":"Thompson","3":"I stayed behind with my partners as the Corrupted launched a new round of attack just when I was about to return."},{"T":"301","2":"Thompson","3":"Compared to my child's match, it's more important to save the partners in front of me."},{"T":"301","2":"Thompson","3":"Perhaps some people could handle everything at ease, but not me."},{"T":"301","2":"Thompson","3":"So instead of worrying or regretting it, I choose to do what I'm capable of first."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"What you're capable of... huh?"},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Then it's better if you hold your left hand still."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Well... let me adjust it for you."},{"T":"301","2":"Thompson","3":"Thanks."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"You're not exactly excellent in combat, so why do you go up to the front?"},{"T":"301","2":"Thompson","3":"Because it's what we should do on the surface."},{"T":"301","2":"Thompson","3":"To save our wounded partners off the battlefield and fight side by side with them on it."},{"T":"301","2":"Thompson","3":"Besides, it's something I promised my child.

As everyone knows, the Support Constructs will be their strongest backup."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"It's just supporting..."},{"T":"301","2":"Thompson","3":"Supporting is not as easy as you imagine."},{"T":"301","2":"Thompson","3":"It's to provide proper offensive assistance for Attackers, rather than getting in the way."},{"T":"301","2":"Thompson","3":"You must understand and familiarize everyone's fighting style and rhythm.

You never thought that we Constructs would tell this kind of thing to a human like you before that battle, right?"},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"Hearing what Thompson has said, Wanshi turns silent, not realizing that the adjustment has been completed at some point.

The influence of the EMP has been completely removed."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"That's something I don't deserve..."},{"T":"301","2":"Thompson","3":"What?"},{"T":"301","3":"Wanshi gets up and sets his tools aside before walking out of the shelter."},{"T":"301","3":"Just as he leaves, Wanshi suddenly inhales the smoke outside.
