[{"T":"301","3":"Despite not knowing what is happening, Lucia seems to have sensed the impending danger, and she follows her mother's instructions and takes Luna to the second floor."},{"T":"302","2":"What's wrong?"},{"T":"301","3":"You ask, perplexed, but Lucia does not answer. You can only follow closely behind."},{"T":"301","3":"You two run into the bedroom at the end of the corridor. Lucia closes the door before running to the window and checking on her mother."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Mom..."},{"T":"301","3":"She sees the end of the world."},{"T":"301","3":"Outside the window, people are crying and whimpering. Everyone in town is trying to hide from the unknown terror. They are all trying to escape the house toward the woods, toward the sliver of hope to survive."},{"T":"301","3":"They rush to the gate outside Luna's house. Someone is banging on the door angrily\u2014fear and rage have twisted all their faces, turning the familiar neighbors into strangers."},{"T":"301","3":"The Punishing Virus, meanwhile, floods into every corner of the town. The scarlet Corrupted chase down and toy with the armless humans like starved zombies."},{"T":"301","3":"You see 'your' father attempting to come through against the tide of people, but he is too far away. So far that you cannot even tell whose name he is shouting."},{"T":"301","3":"But the thinly dressed man has barely shouted before being caught up by the 'sheriff,' whom he once proudly fought side by side. It opens its gaping metal jaw and crushes his head like a roaring flame devouring the land."},{"T":"301","3":"The waning faces you once saw in the hazy light in the M.I.N.D. suddenly clear up, like tearing a wound open, revealing the blood and flesh within."},{"T":"301","3":"'Your' mother, her hands trembling, is trying to move everything she can find in the garden behind the gate, hoping to keep the mechanical monsters on the other side."},{"T":"301","3":"She is such a kind mother\u2014she always brings daisies from the market and gives them to the young girl in the wheelchair on the street, who was busking because she could not afford a mechanical prosthetic."},{"T":"301","3":"During Thanksgiving, the elderly people who live alone in the town will always receive cookies she bakes herself. She always has 'you' help out in order to teach you to be kind and strong."},{"T":"301","3":"Her hands should be dancing on the piano, carrying a bouquet, or holding a bowl of hot soup."},{"T":"301","3":"Not drenching in blood, shaking, desperately trying to keep the gates closed."},{"T":"301","3":"She has to keep the others out, even those innocent and helpless. She watches them as the monsters strike, despite her husband being among them just a moment ago."},{"T":"301","3":"But all is futile."},{"T":"301","3":"The Corrupted and blood-soaked hands of pleading humans reach for her from the spaces between the bars, and with the most harrowing screams, they try to drag the poor woman into the abyss."},{"T":"301","2":"Mom","3":"\u2014\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"The last thing between the monsters and her daughters is her. She turns her back to the gate, pushing back, shaking from their unrelenting force. She looks toward the window on the second floor, where you are standing."},{"T":"301","3":"Tears cover her face. She leaves her last words as she weeps."},{"T":"301","2":"Mom","3":"\u2014Lucia, protect your sister."},{"T":"301","2":"Mom","3":"\u2014Run."},{"T":"301","3":"A terrifying mechanical arm pierces her chest, the blood pouring out of her scorches warmer than every embrace she has given... You cannot tell if those who tear her apart are monsters or broken humans after that."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...Run, Luna. Run."},{"T":"301","3":"The young girl's voice trembles. Her small, delicate hand tries to grab ahold of yours, only to find nothing there."},{"T":"301","3":"That is when she turns toward you. You see tears rolling down her cheeks, but she is not crying. She shows no expression, and you wonder if she registers what is happening at all."},{"T":"301","3":"This time she grabs your hand tightly, the feeling of her warm and soaked grip uncomfortably realistic."},{"T":"301","3":"Then she drags you and runs."},{"T":"301","3":"Run. But where to? What are those things? She knows her parents are gone, and no guardian angels are here to save them. Do they not deserve it? Have they done something wrong? Mom never told her. Where should she go?"},{"T":"301","3":"Your eyes are soaked. Lucia has grabbed one of your hands, so you use your free arm to wipe your eyes. Nothing has ever poured out of you like this, save for vital fluid in previous battles."},{"T":"301","3":"Approaching the bedroom door, you trip on a doll and fall."},{"T":"301","3":"Your visuals drop. Time seems to dilate at that moment, and you notice that the doll that tripped you is an ugly stuffed frog, with its glass eyes and bright-red lips sewn on its woolly fabric."},{"T":"301","3":"'I've seen it before.'"},{"T":"301","3":"'It looks fluffy and soft, unlike the first time I saw it.'"},{"T":"301","3":"Those thoughts occupy your mind as you are about to fall to the ground, but someone catches you. You land instead in a tender, somehow briny, embrace."},{"T":"302","2":"What happened?"},{"T":"301","3":"You know what happened, but the owner of these memories is so frightened and lost. Her confusion takes over you, and you cannot help but ask."},{"T":"302","2":"Dad and Mom were bleeding so much..."},{"T":"302","2":"Everyone was..."},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia holds you in your arms, trying to warm her sister with her own body's warmth. She takes a deep breath next to your ear\u2014your face is buried in her arms, so you cannot tell her expression."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...Luna, do you remember the two of us sneaking on Dad's terminal?"},{"T":"302","2":"Yeah..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"We watched a scary movie with many horrifying monsters, and they ate a lot of people."},{"T":"301","3":"Luna seems to have remembered something, and you tremble even more intensely. Lucia holds you closer."},{"T":"302","2":"It was scary... There was a lot of blood..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Someone is making a horror movie like that in our town. I forgot to tell you."},{"T":"302","2":"How did you know?"},{"T":"301","3":"You hear a loud, dull thud from downstairs. It spreads to your ears like a raindrop falling from a petal into the mud."},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia is breathing harder now."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Dad told me, and he said not to tell you. He wanted to scare you."},{"T":"302","2":"...Really?","4":"I don't believe you..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"It's true! Luna, I'd never lie to you. If I do, I'm a... I'm a rat!"},{"T":"302","2":"You scared me!"},{"T":"301","3":"More tears roll down your face. You can feel a comfort soothing your fear, despite the real you knowing that this is a lie underneath."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"I'm sorry, Luna... but you're part of the movie as well. They can only shoot it once, so you have to listen to me and perform well, okay?"},{"T":"302","2":"But I don't want to... I just want to find Mom and Dad..."},{"T":"301","3":"The sound downstairs is getting closer\u2014the clear and hollow, metallic but dull echos."},{"T":"301","3":"Loosening her hug, Lucia instead grabs your shoulders and looks straight at you. The tears on her face have almost dried, and she has never looked so serious."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"You're a grown-up now, Luna. You have to be strong. Even when Mom and Dad are not here with you, you have to be strong."},{"T":"302","2":"Will you be here with me the whole time?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"I will. Now, you have to act brave. You're going to waste everybody's effort if you don't."},{"T":"302","2":"...Okay. Will it be scary?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"A little bit, but you don't need to be afraid. I'll come back for you."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"You're the best at hide-and-seek, aren't you?"},{"T":"302","2":"...I am!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Don't let the monsters catch you."},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia stands and pulls you up."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Hide in the basement, now!"},{"T":"302","2":"Come with me..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"The monsters are inside already... If someone doesn't distract them, we'll both get caught!"},{"T":"302","2":"But..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"I'll come back for you."},{"T":"301","3":"'I'll come back for you.'"},{"T":"301","3":"No. 21 looks at the girl before her, her promise so unwavering."},{"T":"301","3":"Never in her life has she heard a promise like that, whether as a human in the research institute or a Construct in Cerberus."},{"T":"301","3":"Affected by this memory, an unknown strength spreads through her body. She genuinely believes everything the girl before her has said, and No. 21 cannot tell if it comes from the memory or herself."},{"T":"301","3":"The two girls look at each other and nod. That is the last communication between them."}]
