After leaving Kurono and joining Gray Raven, my faith in humanity was restored."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Oh, you're as sweet as ever."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"I choose my words depending on the person. And for you, I'd prefer brevity."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Let's not waste time, what do you want?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Oh, ahaha, you're still so volatile, alright\u2014"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"I'm sure you've all noticed that signal from the Construct Tifa, yes?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Let me tell you a little something. This Tifa is our target this time, the 'Iron Maiden'."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Oh, I couldn't have guessed."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"No, I mean that\u2014she is 'our' target."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"What?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Oh my? Your commandant looks quite interesting, can we have a little chat, hmm?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Nice try. I knew it. Speaking with you is a waste of time. And you haven't even answered my question."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"That's not important though, is it? Cerberus never shares its treats with others."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"So you're not going to cooperate."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Or more precisely, disrupt."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Let me get this clear, Vera. If the Iso-Devices aren't deployed as planned, the target may escape. Don't drag us all down because of your own selfishness."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Oh, my child, that?
