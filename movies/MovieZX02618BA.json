Her mechanically-made chip and cords repeat one and only one question\u2014'Why?'"},{"T":"301","3":"\u2014It overwhelms the high-speed data flow in her mind like a storm, capturing every piece of memory whether they are real or only exist in the program's simulation."},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami looks at the scenes in her memory and feels deeply confused but curious."},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami's curiosity, however, is nothing like what humankind feels when seeing something they've never seen\u2014rather, she is feeling curious about how she came into being."},{"T":"301","3":"Why?"},{"T":"301","3":"How did the machines manage to awaken when they were man-made?"},{"T":"301","3":"And for what?"},{"T":"301","3":"In different futures, Nanami comes across mechanoids like herself\u2014who are fond of humans and pursue human consciousness. And there are those like Gabriel\u2014who believe power is everything\u2014and those from 'Gear' who are set on fighting humans. They don't fight to live, but to find the meaning of war."},{"T":"301","3":"What's the point of war anyway?"},{"T":"301","3":"Why did Punishing appear? Why would it fall upon the earth?

Nanami could almost see a promising future in those eyes."},{"T":"301","3":"She grabs the finger of that human."},{"T":"301","3":"The human pats her forehead.
