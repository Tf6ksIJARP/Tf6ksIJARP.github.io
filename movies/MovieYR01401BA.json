Has the route alliance been fighting them?"},{"T":"301","2":"Construct B","3":"From our observations over our visit, this does seem to be the case. This is something that only happens in this polar region."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"The numbers on the report shouldn't have any mistakes, right?"},{"T":"301","3":"On the snow, a group of Constructs and a Commandant discuss the current situation."},{"T":"301","3":"The Commandant, who doesn't look in good shape, leans on a tree in the middle of the discussion to make it more comfortable. The Construct also express concern for his physical condition."},{"T":"301","2":"Construct A","3":"Commandant Simon, should we head back to the alliance Stronghold first?"},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"I have a little OCD, so I will be even more uncomfortable if I don't sort out the current problems."},{"T":"301","3":"And so he sits on the ground and picks up a fallen branch to make a map in the snow."},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"This route is not under attack by unknown bionic machines. Their defense is insufficient, so they have asked Babylonia to lend support."},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"And the higher ups have decided to divide the support in two stages. The first stage would be done by us, land forces that can be deployed immediately."},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"The second stage will be done by the support sent from Babylonia, led by one of the Forest Guard and named Rosetta."},{"T":"301","2":"Construct A","3":"So the support should be arriving in a few days, right?"},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"Yes.
