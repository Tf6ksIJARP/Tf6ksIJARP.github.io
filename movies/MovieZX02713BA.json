She places her hands before her chest, having made up her mind."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Nanami... has something very important to do."},{"T":"301","3":"Trailblazer still stands at the front of the frigate, his expression hidden as he stares at Babylonia, which seems to be an arm's length away."},{"T":"301","2":"Trailblazer","3":"It has been... 300 seconds since Haicma invaded Babylonia."},{"T":"301","3":"He glances at the side where Haicma is safely placed, her consciousness still deeply engaged in the infiltration."},{"T":"301","2":"Trailblazer","3":"According to the battle protocols of Project Ark... Haicma's infiltration is considered a failure."},{"T":"301","2":"Trailblazer","3":"Setting course for Babylonia complete. If I don't return in 1800 seconds, the frigate will crash into Babylonia."},{"T":"301","2":"Trailblazer","3":"Our operation might have failed, but at least we can strike a heavy blow at the humans, buying the Church enough time to launch another wave of attack."},{"T":"301","3":"With that, Trailblazer ignites his thrusters, its blinding flame separating him from the frigate's artificial gravity. He begins to hover, and his laser blade generators start to glow brightly."},{"T":"301","2":"Trailblazer","3":"Entering the next phase of Project Ark. This is 'Chariot'\u2014Trailblazer, launching an assault on Babylonia...!"},{"T":"301","3":"At this moment, the alarm on the frigate starts blaring. The system shows an object flying toward the ship at incredible speed."},{"T":"301","2":"Trailblazer","3":"So, the Babylonians have discovered us... Beginning intercept!"},{"T":"301","3":"The frigate fires its anti-ballistic missiles, but the aged defense system struggles to hit the glowing object flying at the speed of a shooting star and accelerating still."},{"T":"301","2":"Trailblazer","3":"It's going to hit us!

You are no Construct. You are a machine like us."},{"T":"301","3":"The girl before him does not attack.

And what do the humans do, having been responsible for all these disasters? They slaughter us like monsters."},{"T":"301","3":"The girl does not refute him. Instead, she nods solemnly."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"You're right, and this will lead to a full-scale war between machines and humans in the future.

The Church of Machina is working to change the future. If we are destined to fight, machines simply have to eliminate humankind now. We can then take our kin away from Earth without humanity's threat."},{"T":"301","3":"Trailblazer extends the full arsenal on his body. He is, in his entirety, a mechanized organism designed only for killing."},{"T":"301","2":"Trailblazer","3":"My human creator made me to kill other humans. My purpose was this simple and pure... See? Even humans couldn't be 'friends' with each other. What you're hoping for is a mere fantasy."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Just like how we are awakening, humans are also trying to change themselves, tending to and befriending each other. I think the future this power can create is beyond Gestalt's calculation."},{"T":"301","2":"Trailblazer","3":"Is this the ending you've calculated, then?"},{"T":"301","3":"The girl shakes her head playfully and smiles."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Not really. This is Nanami's 'belief'!"},{"T":"301","2":"Trailblazer","3":"'Belief.' That's a nice word. I'll remember it."},{"T":"301","2":"Trailblazer","3":"Nanami... That's your name, isn't it? If you and I believe in a different future, then we shall perform an experiment to test which hypothesis has the strength to forge a path onward."},{"T":"301","3":"Trailblazer stops talking, rerouting all his computing power to his tactical circuit. Despite how frail the girl looks, her mech less armed, Trailblazer somehow knows that he cannot underestimate her."},{"T":"301","2":"Trailblazer","3":"I will do my best to defeat you!"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"And Nanami will do her best to stop you!"},{"T":"301","3":"Their light weaving together, the thrusters of the two giant machines ignite at the same time."}]
