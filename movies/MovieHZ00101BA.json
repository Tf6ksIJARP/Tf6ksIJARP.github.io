[{"T":"301","2":"Celica","3":"Here is a summary of recent reports, President Hassen."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Thank you."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"...Just as I thought."},{"T":"301","2":"Celica","3":"What's going on?"},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"The Corrupted are becoming more active. Is it because of the polymer materials that have fallen to Earth...? Or something else..."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Whatever it is, we have to deal with them."},{"T":"301","3":"As Hassen and Celica talk, Asimov enters from the side. Extracting the map from Hassen's file, he projects it on-screen."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Just as the Science Council predicted. The Corrupted are becoming more active, with even the tendency to congregate into makeshift armies."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"It used to be that they followed instinct towards the same place. Now, they seem to be massing for coordinated attacks."},{"T":"301","2":"Celica","3":"Did our operations to regain lost ground affect the Corrupted's movement patterns?"},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Maybe, maybe not. After all, Corrupted don't think like wild beasts."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"By your being here, Asimov, I take it that your department has already come up with a solution for this situation?"},{"T":"301","3":"In answer, Asimov pulls up blueprints for a Construct module on-screen."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"What's this?"},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"A Construct expansion module, named 'Inver-Sync'."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"To fight an army of Corrupted, we need an army of our own, which we realistically cannot field."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"That's why we must unite the few Elite-level Constructs we have, and use them to elevate our entire force."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"So this module... can turn everyone into elite combatants?"},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Yes. Once Inver-Sync is activated, all Constructs in the area of operations can be linked, sharing each other's thoughts and connections."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"And achieve the 'All Are One' combat doctrine."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"...How's the module production going?"},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"We can ensure a certain usable amount, but the assembly line is unstable. Babylonia has many more pressing projects, after all."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Is that so... But as you said, my original intent was to meet the Corrupted, pound for pound."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"After all, there's no way we're letting the Corrupted congregate unchecked. It would spell disaster if they were allowed to expand."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Celica."},{"T":"301","2":"Celica","3":"Yes, sir. What are your orders?"},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Recall all units available back to Babylonia. Asimov, you will coordinate efforts to install these modules on all Class 2 combatants."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Class 2... why not Class 1? Advanced Constructs would coordinate teams better."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"We'll hold the advanced Constructs back, in case anything unexpected happens. It'd be trouble if the commanding Construct had to face powerful Corrupted alone. Better leave this to Class 1 Constructs."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"...It's just as well. I'm just the one who makes the tools. How you wield them is up to you."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"It's settled then. Broadcast the orders, Celica. It is time for Joint Warfare."}]
