[{"T":"301","3":"After defeating the enemies, we quickly ran up the stairs and went through many battle scenes that didn't really match the background settings."},{"T":"301","2":"Karenina","3":"These scenes have nothing to do with our main plot!"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"I guess Celica only had access to these materials. We're lucky that we aren't stuck. When I watched Kamui play other games..."},{"T":"302","2":"You are always talking about Kamui.","4":"Who's better at playing games, you or Kamui?"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Ahem... Not at all. I just happen to inherit all the game-related topics from his memory!"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Isn't it obvious? I will never lose to that fool in anything."},{"T":"301","3":"Eventually, we jumped across a staircase (broken for no reason) and arrived at a special room."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"I have been watching you since you approached the castle... You took a long time to get here, heroes."},{"T":"301","3":"Apart from some enemies that we previously encountered, there was one figure that gave a very different feel."},{"T":"301","2":"Karenina","3":"Hey, you are the Demon General, aren't you?"},{"T":"301","3":"Vera and Camu were ready to start fighting, but Karenina walked forward and triggered the dialogue."},{"T":"301","3":"It wasn't because she liked to follow orders, but because she preferred to ask the enemies' names before beating them."},{"T":"301","3":"Either way, the enemy would still be beaten up, but at least it felt better than straight-forward violence."},{"T":"301","2":"Zanzibaron","3":"Right. I am Demon General Zanzibaron."},{"T":"301","3":"Zanzibaron\u2014I had no clue where that name came from\u2014moved one step forward, dragging his gigantic body."},{"T":"301","2":"Zanzibaron","3":"You must be the heroes in the revelation.

I wasn't interested in your story, and I will not listen to it. Learning your name is more than enough!"},{"T":"301","2":"Zanzibaron","3":"!?"},{"T":"301","3":"Well, Karenina was only following her own rules.
