Her personality data is normal."},{"T":"301","2":"MPA-01","3":"Currently, her thought process and behavioral logic are akin to a human's. Out of the twelve humanoid subjects, only Nanami has shown this trait."},{"T":"301","2":"Female Researcher","3":"That's right... She's special."},{"T":"301","2":"MPA-01","3":"I switched to Personality 134 in order to have a more effective conversation and record changes in her emotions."},{"T":"301","2":"MPA-01","3":"But she questioned my behavior, believing I was not talking to her 'as myself.'"},{"T":"301","2":"Female Researcher","3":"'As yourself'?"},{"T":"301","2":"MPA-01","3":"Without activating my personality module."},{"T":"301","3":"The administrative AI sounds hesitant."},{"T":"301","2":"MPA-01","3":"I have performed self-test on all my modules, but I have not detected any anomalies.

Talk to her 'as yourself.'"},{"T":"301","2":"MPA-01","3":"Understood."},{"T":"301","2":"Female Researcher","3":"...You called her name instead of her code, didn't you?

Leaves fall from her body, and as she sweeps away the dry leaves around her, she remembers falling asleep by the latest graffiti found."},{"T":"301","3":"'Sage's' murals have also been changing. They are no longer simply colorful expressions of her feelings and depictions of the new friends she made, but also information about humans and observations on nature."},{"T":"301","3":"Haicma is basically certain that the girl she has been searching for is the person who left these murals behind."},{"T":"301","3":"She has traveled a long way following the graffiti. She has seen seasons change, sunrises and moonsets, morning dew forming then evaporating, snow covering fallen leaves, and seeds sprouting as it melts, paving a green trail."},{"T":"301","3":"Guided by the murals, Haicma feels everything in her journey. Her behavior gradually grows more spontaneous, such as insisting on stopping somewhere high on nights with clear sky and plentiful stars."},{"T":"301","3":"She no longer searches for books Nanami might be interested in for location data only. She does it to understand further the humans Nanami is interested in, and she would stay at all kinds of human heritage sites."},{"T":"301","3":"Right now, Haicma is standing in an abandoned library. She was reading the books stored here before she went to sleep."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"Is that why you're so interested in human culture?"},{"T":"301","3":"The ideas and cultures humankind has left behind are so different, so vast, and so everchanging."},{"T":"301","3":"The diverse ways humankind could perceive the world were why their ideas created so many sparks, generating even more possibilities."},{"T":"301","3":"Those complex and glistening possibilities created a beautiful vision of the future. The storm-weathered ruins tell of the glorious age humans were in as they headed closer toward that bright future every day."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"Row 3, column 78. Starting here."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"'...The fatal flaw of machines\u2014the flaw that saves humanity from being ruled by them\u2014is that they cannot predict the evershifting possibility of the human world.'"},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"Slowly walking along the shelves, Haicma searches for books that are legible and less damaged."},{"T":"301","3":"That is when she notices a familiar name. She steps forward, taking a book from an unassuming shelf."},{"T":"301","3":"On the title page is a name that belongs to a famous machine consciousness researcher from the Golden Age. The author's picture on the foldout is blurry beyond recognition save for a gentle smile and blonde hair."},{"T":"301","3":"Haicma knows that smile. She flips open the book."},{"T":"301","3":"\u2014Can humanity consider machines their 'children'? Despite all the theories that deem machines anti-human and destructive, we cannot deny the importance they have bestowed."},{"T":"301","3":"\u2014Just like how our children are our legacy, the machines we built are also the extensions of us."},{"T":"301","3":"\u2014They are nonetheless approaching life from a different angle. We should think about how we can establish more meaningful relationships with them. After all, as our children, they are our pride."},{"T":"301","2":"Male Researcher","3":"She's not a tool."},{"T":"301","2":"Male Researcher","3":"She's my child, and she's... my pride."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"Haicma does not know how to define the feeling she has right now."},{"T":"301","3":"She has so many questions. Even when she knows the objective definition of every emotion, she still cannot truly understand all that is to be a human."},{"T":"301","3":"But an intense curiosity surges in her mind. She desperately wants to ask her creator something, but she fails to compose the right question."},{"T":"301","3":"Most of the machines she has met on her journey are simply repeating the commands they received from humans, mimicking human behaviors."},{"T":"301","3":"Humanity first crawled in the wild before they walked and learned to run. Created by humans, machines are following humanity's footsteps, but they are sprinting\u2014they are evolving so much faster than their creators."},{"T":"301","3":"And when disaster struck, humans began to fear their creations and abandoned them, now hiding among the stars."},{"T":"301","3":"The machines left behind began to search for their purposes. That was when they encountered a special guide. She was kind and patient, teaching them things they never knew."},{"T":"301","3":"\u2014Because the machines have always believed that 'Sagemachina' will show them the way."},{"T":"301","3":"What is the future the creators of machines are expecting?"},{"T":"301","3":"Haicma holds the book close, slowly shutting her eyes."},{"T":"301","3":"She has never felt so unsure and lost."}]
