This place can't be so peaceful."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"During the Golden Age, machines with artificial intelligence were widely used. In places like this where human communities used to live, no matter how much they resisted the convenience of machines, there has got to be some machines around here for public use."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"But it's too quiet right now. It's unlikely that the scavengers got rid of the Corrupted here."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"A place too quiet must be abnormal.
