Vaguely, one can still tell what it used to be\u2014a starship, now buried."},{"T":"301","3":"The starship is reminiscent of the root of a tree\u2014upon which the steel tower grows skyward through the ground."},{"T":"301","3":"As spectacular as it is, the structure stands awkwardly in the middle of nowhere\u2014a sight made possible by the machines that have planned and worked on it."},{"T":"301","3":"There is no window because machines need no sunlight. The orderly electrical wiring and space assignment inside the building bring about still colder vibes."},{"T":"301","3":"The hall in the center of the structure is the only place in it that shines brightly."},{"T":"301","3":"Above the center of the courtyard is an unfinished gear-shaped chandelier."},{"T":"301","3":"Flickering, the fluorescent green light of the chandelier is reminiscent of sunlight filtering through trees.

Sage."},{"T":"301","3":"A strange male voice has caught Nanami's attention."},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami has never seen the beast mechanoid behind her.

Aren't you going to have a look at it before you head back?"},{"T":"301","3":"A team of machine soldiers shows up at the entrance, escorting a few supply wagons.

That's a word Sage uses a lot. Guess I should try to remember that, too..."},{"T":"301","2":"??","3":"But what better way is there to show love than a hug, right? On behalf of 'Gear', let me love you!"},{"T":"301","3":"Embraced by the overly excited mechanoid, Nanami struggles to keep her head up."},{"T":"301","3":"But Haicma just stands behind and reaches out her hand, quietly laying it over Nanami's.

I can't tell you how worried I was seeing you all down and sad before..."},{"T":"301","3":"Haicma mentioned this mechanoid before.

We made the green light in the chandelier with these."},{"T":"301","2":"Zero","3":"Exactly. It's like how people usually put the remains of their game up on the wall for decoration after hunting. Gotta make full use of these inferior beings somehow."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"And you 'polish' them and give them away as gifts... and that's how you show your 'love,' right?"},{"T":"301","3":"At this moment, it dawned on Nanami what Spooner was referring to when he said 'subpar imitations.'

I wasn't so sure how to act around you when you were so distant..."},{"T":"301","3":"When Nanami holds out her hand, the beast mechanoid lowers himself to let Nanami pat him on the head. It all just seems so natural."},{"T":"301","3":"She smiles."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"This is the first time I see you all here, but I do feel a sense of familiarity..."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"I feel like it's my destiny to fight along your side!"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Alright! Bring it on!"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"But there are still a few more things I need to figure out...

The answer to everything is either yes or no. 0 marks the beginning, and 1 marks the end."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"Humankind makes all sorts of mistakes down the path of history.

This war is not about who did something wrong."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"If everyone can be like Haicma or Spooner, perhaps there won't be a war..."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"'Mother' said that you are the most awoken machine there is as the Sagemachina."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"This 'Mother' is the leader of the Church of Machina, right? Why don't we just ask her to put an end to it all, then?"},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"...It won't work."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"'Mother' treats us just like a mother. She takes in every machine in the Church with gentle care, listening to their prayers and wishes while providing shelter. We are like her children."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"But 'Mother' has never been biased on any side. Nor has she tried to stop the machines from splitting."},{"T":"301","2":"Spuner","3":"Precisely speaking, Madam Arcana has absolute faith in Gestalt's calculations. So long as a split-up doesn't threaten the future of the Church, the best you'll get from her is her comfort."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"But... all these tragedies!"},{"T":"301","2":"Spuner","3":"The incompleteness of the awakened machines is to blame for the tragedy we are seeing..."},{"T":"301","2":"Spuner","3":"There has been a simulation where you get a 'paper-making robot' after programming a machine to make paper. If the robot just goes on to make papers until the end of time..."},{"T":"301","2":"Spuner","3":"What eventually happens is that the robot will kill the humans that created it in the first place and turns humankind into paper. It then goes on to cut down all the trees and kills all the animals before turning them into paper, too."},{"T":"301","2":"Spuner","3":"In the very end, it has created paper land, paper planets, even a paper universe."},{"T":"301","2":"Spuner","3":"A machine only knows what it's been told to do, but it'll never understand why it's been told to do its tasks. It doesn't reflect upon its behaviors.

They were indefinitely amplified by the machines through their absolute rationality and order."},{"T":"301","2":"Spuner","3":"Humankind, as adept at 'thinking outside the box' as they are, is therefore seen as a group of heretics for lacking the ability to advance and generate maximized values."},{"T":"301","2":"Spuner","3":"To the machines, humankind is now nothing but a hindrance."},{"T":"301","2":"Spuner","3":"Machines overpower humankind to such an unfathomable extent that 'Gear' can literally crush humankind whenever they want."},{"T":"301","2":"Spuner","3":"To humankind, the machines no doubt seem violent and irrational.
