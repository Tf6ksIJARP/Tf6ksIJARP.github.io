[{"T":"301","3":"The sound of anxious back-and-forth pacing fills the research room, deep in the facility."},{"T":"301","2":"Shome","3":"It's been too long..."},{"T":"301","3":"It is a dimly-lit room, the interior flickering under the weak jaundice of the lighting. To the Ascendant Shome, however, brightness has long since lost its meaning."},{"T":"301","3":"In the middle of the research room lies writhing mechanical remains\u2014some are missing limbs, some have their torsos replaced by monstrous-looking ones, some are left with only their heads."},{"T":"301","3":"Oil, vital fluid, indistinguishable liquids seep from under their bodies."},{"T":"301","3":"The network of attached pipes are endlessly pumping activators inside, forcing these remains awake."},{"T":"301","3":"...Forcing them alive, pumping them with life, making them writhe in sickening madness."},{"T":"301","3":"They squirm and shift, struggling to drag themselves toward Shome. However, the cables and tubes attached to their bodies stop them from ever reaching him."},{"T":"301","3":"Unending hisses and wrathful thrashes of the Corrupted erupt from the back of the research room. The electricity traps on the wall flicker and burn their bodies."},{"T":"301","3":"Their limbs burn, disintegrate, but regenerate, bit by bit. They repeat this cycle over and over, all to break through this wall and reach the research room."},{"T":"301","3":"Why? Because Shome is in the center of the research room, and his hand holds a shot of the Punishing Virus, flashing with scarlet electricity."},{"T":"301","3":"This place should be a familiar sight, but Shome's heart twinges with unease."},{"T":"301","2":"Shome","3":"Seventy-two hours have passed. He would never make such a mistake."},{"T":"301","2":"Shome","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Shome","3":"For safety's sake."},{"T":"301","3":"Shome turns to the console behind him and taps quickly on the screen."},{"T":"301","2":"Shome","3":"Experiment Record No. 70412:"},{"T":"301","2":"Shome","3":"Experimental Ascension Bodies Batch 70411, failed. The initial Ascnet filtering is too much for the current equipment and degree of modification. The impact still cannot be alleviated externally."},{"T":"301","3":"Shome sets the injection aside. He clears his throat before he continues."},{"T":"301","2":"Shome","3":"Hmph, as expected."},{"T":"301","2":"Shome","3":"Based on the initial reactions of the subjects, I'm walking on the right path."},{"T":"301","2":"Shome","3":"Given the right environment and some fine-tuning to the mod-data for the corrupted host, I will definitely succeed."},{"T":"301","2":"Shome","3":"Alright, this should do it for the final recording. Begin data export."},{"T":"301","2":"System","3":"Export command received. ID verification: Dr. Shome. Authority level: EX+. Beginning export procedure."},{"T":"301","3":"The console hums as it runs. Shome walks past the carnage in the room."},{"T":"301","2":"Shome","3":"Experimental Subject No. 65018 lasted a long time in the first filtering. He gave me good refitting materials."},{"T":"301","2":"Shome","3":"Experimental Subject No. 63901. This humanoid was made from the Constructs of the same squad. They were all good raw materials but it's a pity they still couldn't survive the first filtering after fusing them."},{"T":"301","3":"The scenes flash through Shome's mind. Every single experimental subject, taken apart, studied, forced to connect to the Ascension-Network. To Shome, all of the subjects are like his medals of honor."},{"T":"301","2":"System","3":"Data export complete."},{"T":"301","3":"Hearing the system beep, Shome returns to the console. He stows the ejected black cube on himself."},{"T":"301","3":"Mechanical noises ring out from where he stowed the cube. When the noise finally dies down, Shome straightens his clothes and moves, checking to see that the cube is not affecting his movement."},{"T":"301","2":"Shome","3":"Even the most wonderful of times must come to an end. It's time to say goodbye to this place."},{"T":"301","3":"At that, Shome enters the terminal command on the console. Several mechanical arms appear on the walls as the command is executed. The arms dance about the room, dismantling all the machinery one by one."},{"T":"301","3":"Soon, the barely alive mechanical remains become piles of metal scrap."},{"T":"301","2":"System","3":"Bzz\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"After a burst of buzzes, the console and all its mechanical arms fall silent."},{"T":"301","3":"Seeing the research room taken by silence, Shome pushes his glasses lightly and leaves."},{"T":"301","3":"Shome walks alone on the main path of the research facility. Suddenly, he stops at a T-section."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Long time no see, Shome."},{"T":"301","2":"Shome","3":"Hah. You actually came over. Didn't you use to look down on my research?"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Heh. You're the same as ever."},{"T":"301","3":"The speaker steps out casually from the back right corner. He rests his chain blade to one side, then lazily leans against the wall."},{"T":"301","2":"Shome","3":"You seem different from before."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"I did go through a lot in that city after all."},{"T":"301","2":"Shome","3":"You did, didn't you? Judging from the data reports from Kowloong, there were quite a few accidents. But, overall, we can consider it a victory."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"'We?' Hah. All your time was spent holing up in labs around the world, messing around with your pointless research."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"'We,' hah. Almost forgot you're an 'Ascendant.'"},{"T":"301","2":"Shome","3":"You're mostly right, but I must get one thing clear."},{"T":"301","2":"Shome","3":"I am not chosen by Miss Luna, but you and I both serve the Ascension-Network. Technically speaking, we are both Ascendants."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Ahaha. You're becoming just like Gabriel in your pedantry."},{"T":"301","3":"Shome is about to protest, but resigns when he notices Roland rambling without a care for him."},{"T":"301","3":"So Shome merely shakes his head and begins to walk again."},{"T":"301","2":"Shome","3":"I'll listen to your rambles after I come back. I have a new research task on hand."},{"T":"301","3":"Roland pauses and looks at Shome."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"I take it that you aren't coming with us on the next mission, then?"},{"T":"301","2":"Shome","3":"Naturally. My research is what made me live through the filtering, is it not?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Ahaha... Is that so?"},{"T":"301","2":"Shome","3":"Hmph. Which reminds me, how's that device you asked me for working out? You didn't seem to have used it in front of the others. Remember to send me the data after you use it."},{"T":"301","2":"Shome","3":"After all, I'm just a researcher with zero combative capabilities. All this killing and fighting\u2014I'll leave it to you professionals."},{"T":"301","3":"Shome strolls past Roland, walking toward the left of the intersection."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Hah. A researcher with zero combative capabilities, you say. Never knew these researchers could leisurely fix all the hidden turrets on someone pointing a piece at 'em."},{"T":"301","2":"Shome","3":"If you really wanted me dead, I'd be long dead before all this turret business."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"...Oh, what a spoilsport you are."},{"T":"301","2":"Shome","3":"Born this way."},{"T":"301","3":"Shome pushes his glasses up again. With no intention to fool around with Roland, he leaves through the passage."},{"T":"301","3":"Roland puts away his scythe gun after he speaks, and walks in the completely opposite direction of Shome, to the other end of the corridor."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Looks like the rat came out of its hole."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Indeed. But why all this hassle anyway? It'd be easier for me to just off him right now."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Then we cannot weed out all of his labs."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Fine, fine, I got it."},{"T":"301","3":"Roland displays his impatience in full, waving his hand to cut Gabriel off. From outside of the facility, Gabriel puts away the book he was reading and steps into the light."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"You know, if you weren't sitting here, I might have already popped a cap in him."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"You cannot bear the consequences of doing so."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Pah... Enough of that. What about the others?"},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Alpha has set off. I'm ready too."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Hah, well, well. Guess it's finally time."},{"T":"301","3":"Roland stretches as he walks past Gabriel. Gabriel turns to face the research facility, removing his hat in a salute. He returns the hat and catches up to Roland."},{"T":"301","3":"A loud explosion booms from behind, and the research facility collapses in the blast. The heatwave sends the coats of the two fluttering wildly."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Now then, let the game begin."}]
