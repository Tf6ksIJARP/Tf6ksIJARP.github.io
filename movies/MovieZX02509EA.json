Please stop beating us."},{"T":"301","2":"MC Solar","3":"We just want to make a living."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"You can make a living in many ways.

We started a band, hoping to become prominent."},{"T":"301","2":"MC Solar","3":"But our dream was only a dream. The interviewer only cared about looks, not your performance."},{"T":"301","2":"MC Solar","3":"We tried to sing our songs, but no one seemed to cherish them. We had no supporters, so we had to go backstage."},{"T":"301","2":"MC Solar","3":"No longer musicians, we became their pets.

Pulao looks at the beaten-up crowd in front and thinks for a while before she speaks."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"You said being the Gung-hoers was just a job.

Why are you cutting yourself? Stop it!"},{"T":"301","3":"Pulao quickly steps forward, trying to stop MC Solar's strange action. To her surprise, he is moving extremely fast, as if her words have revitalized him. He continues to run from Pulao and shouts in the martial arts club."},{"T":"301","2":"MC Solar","3":"I, MC Solar, hereby pledge to always treat Pulao as my big sis no matter what happens! Lucky Dog, Ding Gold, get me a bowl. I'm gonna swear an alliance of blood!"},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"Please, don't do that!"},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"Demon Bane, Heaven Breaker?
