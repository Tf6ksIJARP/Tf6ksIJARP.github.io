In my memories, we were together one day, and in the next, I was suddenly and inexplicably alone."},{"T":"301","3":"I could not find info about my previous commandant, nor could I access the files on my former comrades. It was as if it was only me all along."},{"T":"301","3":"Shards of my lost memories contest this statement."},{"T":"301","3":"I vague remember the members of the old Gray Raven, and the old commandant's tactical preferences."},{"T":"301","3":"Tandem attacks were a Gray Raven specialty."},{"T":"301","2":"Corrupted","3":"\u2014."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Hey, I'm over here! Where're you going!?"},{"T":"301","2":"Corrupted","3":"Urgh!"},{"T":"301","3":"That was our Corrupted rabbit, Hiro."},{"T":"301","3":"Equipped for short-duration flight, Hiro would use his speed to bait the enemy into traps and ambushes."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"The rest have been drawn off. We've just got this Riot left, right?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Affirmative. Take down the Riot model before Hiro comes back, then sweep and clear all Corrupted elements."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Five-by-five! Let's go, Murol!"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Go right, I'll go left!"},{"T":"301","3":"The one on the left was Murol, Xun on the right.
