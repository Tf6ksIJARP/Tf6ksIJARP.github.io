[{"T":"301","2":"Corrupted","3":"\u2014!"},{"T":"301","2":"Soldier A","3":"Whew... It's over, eh?"},{"T":"301","3":"After taking out all the attackers, the group blanks out for a moment, collectively forgetting what they had been doing before the battle began."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"What are you people doing? Start collecting our things!"},{"T":"301","3":"Camu's squad is sent on a new mission to transport some packages for Kurono."},{"T":"301","3":"Like their supplies, the items are sent to them via airdrop. The packages are heavily bundled up and come with small filters, perhaps for secrecy or other reasons."},{"T":"301","3":"While receiving their shipment, Camu's squad is attacked by a Corrupted horde."},{"T":"301","2":"Soldier A","3":"Oh, yeah... Come help, everyone..."},{"T":"301","3":"As the other members come back to their senses and are about to help with the supplies, a scream rings out right next to Camu."},{"T":"301","2":"Soldier","3":"Ahhhhhhhh!"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Hey! What's wrong?"},{"T":"301","3":"The screams increase in volume. The soldier is lying face-down on the ground, scratching at his own arms and neck."},{"T":"301","3":"His face turns purple. As if suffocating, he starts struggling to pull off his protective gear in attempt to breathe better."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Stop! Taking off your gear here? Are you off your rocker?"},{"T":"301","2":"Soldier","3":"Ahhhhh! It hurts... And so itchy..."},{"T":"301","2":"Soldier","3":"Aaaaaaaahhhh!"},{"T":"301","3":"The squad members surround the screamer, trying to figure out what is going on, while Camu keeps shaking him in hopes of keeping him calm."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Where are you hurting? Were you injured in the battle? Or are you sick?"},{"T":"301","2":"Soldier","3":"Aaaahhhh! I don't know... don't know, Camu!"},{"T":"301","3":"His whole body is in pain and drastically weakened. It is as if lava is churning in his brain."},{"T":"301","3":"The man manages to spit out a few words as he writhes on the ground. Camu touches his body and senses a strong heat radiating from his skin."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Oh, right... the serum! Someone fetch the serum!"},{"T":"301","2":"Soldier A","3":"Got it! Give him a shot now!"},{"T":"301","3":"Some other members had already gone off to fetch the serum before Camu's shout, as this is not the first time something like this has happened."},{"T":"301","3":"Though they have no idea what the reason is, squad members would sometimes suddenly fall down in excruciating pain and lose all control over their limbs."},{"T":"301","3":"Kurono's response to situations like this is always: 'More serum.'"},{"T":"301","3":"But the official solution did not seem to work this time. They give the soldier the shot, but things do not take a turn for the better."},{"T":"301","2":"Soldier","3":"Camu... Camu..."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"What?"},{"T":"301","2":"Soldier","3":"Ugh... we... we're real unlucky, huh..."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Hey, what do you mean? His vitals are\u2014Hey! Hey! Wake up!"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Dammit!"},{"T":"301","3":"\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"According to the contract they signed, all bodies of squad members must be returned to Kurono. Along with the delivery, Camu brings his dead squadmate there."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"I'm here to make a delivery... yet you won't even let me into the city?"},{"T":"301","2":"Guard","3":"It's part of the contract. Don't try to force your way in, or we'll shoot."},{"T":"301","3":"Camu is held up at the gate while his 'packages' are brought into the city right away."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Yeah, I know you'll shoot. Anyway, what's happened to this dude? If you guys want the body, it means you'll give him an autopsy, right?"},{"T":"301","2":"Guard","3":"I said don't move!"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"What's happening?"},{"T":"301","3":"Camu notices that the guards are on high alert\u2014not because of the contractual obligations, but a sort of instinctive reaction."},{"T":"301","3":"With every step Camu takes towards the guard, he takes one step back and clutches his weapon tighter."},{"T":"301","3":"It was the same when they took in the body. Those people seemed disproportionately nervous, as if Camu was handing over an explosive."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Tell me what you know."},{"T":"301","3":"Clenching his fist, Camu marches towards the guards, who immediately open fire without bothering to issue a warning according to the rules."},{"T":"301","2":"Guard","3":"Dammit! Told you to stay back!"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Tch..."},{"T":"301","3":"Camu knows better than to cause a scene here, so he gives up his questioning attempt and backs up, finally fleeing the city amidst gunfire."},{"T":"301","3":"What happened to his squadmate? And what do the Kurono guards know?"},{"T":"301","3":"What will happen to him and the other squad members?"},{"T":"301","3":"The questions still plague Camu's mind."},{"T":"301","3":"Meanwhile, a man stands on the city's lookout platform. He watches the retreating figure and presses a button on his communications device."},{"T":"301","2":"Mao Zhen","3":"Mao Zhen speaking. The 'monsters' have left the city."},{"T":"301","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Mao Zhen","3":"It's only been a short time since these models have been employed in operations before the 'accidental' deaths began. I'm truly regretful."},{"T":"301","2":"Mao Zhen","3":"And the deaths have become increasingly frequent. Our 'monsters' might not have much time left."},{"T":"301","2":"Mao Zhen","3":"So we should just go ahead without any ado, huh? Got it. How about we send them to 'that place', then?"},{"T":"301","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Mao Zhen","3":"Yes. As a member of the Special Security Department, I'll handle this."}]
