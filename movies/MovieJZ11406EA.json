This is as far as we're allowed to operate."},{"T":"301","3":"The unrelenting nightmare of the past eats away at the Arctic. It binds itself around not only Rosetta and Pfaff, but also the Forest Guards... and everyone here."},{"T":"301","3":"Rosetta peers at Temia with disappointment. She grits her teeth, and shuffles Pfaff on her back again."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"I see..."},{"T":"301","3":"The look in the girl's eyes tears at Temia's heart more than ever, even harder than the day she lost everything and became a Forest Guard."},{"T":"301","3":"But she does not catch up to Rosetta, for she has too much to bear.

The technicians step forward, beginning to prepare to dismantle the narwhal."},{"T":"301","2":"Port Manager","3":"He gave his life for the Arctic Route Union. I will honor my promise to him and allow you to join us."},{"T":"301","3":"The port manager pats Rosetta on the shoulder, but she shakes him off vehemently."},{"T":"301","2":"Port Manager","3":"What are you doing?!"},{"T":"301","3":"Rosetta grabs her spear and stands before the port manager and the others, blocking their path to the forest."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"The narwhal, Derek... is our Guardian Spirit and my friend.

Good..."},{"T":"301","3":"Badly wounded, Rosetta is no longer able to provide any more support. She collapses onto the ground, completely unconscious."},{"T":"301","2":"Port Man","3":"Kill her!
