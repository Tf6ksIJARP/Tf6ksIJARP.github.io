There is only the rotten, moldy smell of the basement and the touches of the heaps of junk as you run into them."},{"T":"301","3":"Then a bright light tears down the darkness. You cannot help but open the door slightly and look out carefully through the gap, and all you can see is a corner of the staircase."},{"T":"301","3":"The sound of metal dragging over the wooden floor gives you a shiver. Then you hear the heavy thud of a body hitting something, and nothing after that."},{"T":"301","3":"An impulsion drives you to scream Lucia's name... but you must not.
