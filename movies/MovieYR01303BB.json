Commandant! Move outta the way!"},{"T":"301","3":"Tunnel-visioned by the ball, Kamui comes dashing over, trying to hit it back to the opponent's court. He tries to brake before he crashes into you, but instead, he hurls himself over from the sudden pause."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"\u2014!!"},{"T":"301","3":"And you both end up in a pile on the beach."},{"T":"301","3":"\u2014Thump.

I know Kamui often goes on solo missions, but when we operate as a unit, it's important to work with the other members."},{"T":"301","3":"Liv sounds serious."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Got it."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Winning or losing does hinge on your teammates, huh."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"You meanie!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Let's try something less heated."},{"T":"302","2":"Alright."},{"T":"301","3":"The temperature seems to have warmed up a little.

You'll have to perform a daring forfeit!'"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"'The questions can be selected from a list in the system, or you can ask your own questions.' Hmm... This is a multi-player thing, so this is my first time playing this too."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"It sounds somewhat similar to tactical response training. Commandant and I developed a similar training program before. Commandant would ask the questions, and I'd answer..."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Oh! Liv, you have experience playing this? Then you and Commandant go first!"},{"T":"302","2":"Sure."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"I will think about it carefully and try to get the right answer!"},{"T":"302","2":"Relax, this is just a game.","4":"This is not training, no need to be so nervous."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Yes! Let's all do our best, Commandant."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Ah, you're right... But I'll still do my best!"}]
