[{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"Hiding in an inconspicuous corner on the streets, Murray is fiddling with his terminal and controlling the lure program in his guise."},{"T":"301","3":"Valeria and Bazhi are closing in on him, creeping to around ten meters behind."},{"T":"301","3":"An uncanny hint runs down Murray's spine. He stops controlling the terminal, and the lure program also stands frozen like a statue."},{"T":"301","3":"Murray turns around. Valeria and Bazhi walk out of the shadows from both of Murray's flanks."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"Ah, as expected of Scarab. Faster than I thought."},{"T":"301","2":"Bazhi","3":"Pah. Whatever you took from Gestalt, you're gonna spit it all out... piece by piece."},{"T":"301","2":"Valeria","3":"Don't try anything funny."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"And if I refuse?"},{"T":"301","2":"Valeria","3":"Then we'll be taking it from a dead body. Not much of a difference."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"I see... So you've only been ordered to track and intercept, but not to eliminate."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"Otherwise, I wouldn't even be standing here, would I? You don't want trouble unless things go south, yes?"},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"Which means... we can strike a deal."},{"T":"301","3":"Bazhi remains unseen, but Murray can feel her appendages surrounding him. They remain at a slight distance, writhing around and checking."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"Ahaha, you're learning... But it's okay, I've run out of welcome gifts."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"Now then, back to the topic."},{"T":"301","3":"Murray spreads his hands. The terminal containing a whole host of data is laid bare before Valeria's eyes."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"Do you know what's in this?"},{"T":"301","2":"Valeria","3":"I'm not interested. And if it makes you feel better, we're not afraid of 'things going south.'"},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"I see. You're 'not interested,' which is why you ask no questions. For Commander Nikola, you'd indeed be a handier tool than me."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"That must be why he said he approves of my capabilities... but still sent you here."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"No... Or perhaps, he really does approve of me\u2014that's why he sent you here. If that's the case, my oh my, what an honor."},{"T":"301","3":"Murray's usual smile returns."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"Well then, guess I better not disappoint him."},{"T":"301","2":"Bazhi","3":"You done?"},{"T":"301","2":"Valeria","3":"You're a smart guy. Cooperating is in your best interest here."},{"T":"301","2":"Valeria","3":"But... smart guys should remember to clear their access logs. Pity."},{"T":"301","3":"With that, Valeria motions to Bazhi. Her appendages immediately pierce through Murray's body."},{"T":"301","3":"But, he gives no reaction."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"Surprise! The lure is the real one, and the real one is the lure."},{"T":"301","3":"The phantom Murray, now pierced by several appendages, is no longer moving, but voice is still coming out of his mouth."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"Thank you for your cooperation."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"And thank you for listening to my speech. That gave me enough time to unload the immersion program."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"Quite a shame I don't get to see your expressions from the lure program, but I bet it'd make a stellar memory."},{"T":"301","3":"Blue streams of data begin to disperse from the 'lure program' afar."},{"T":"301","2":"Bazhi","3":"Dammit, V! Get him!"},{"T":"301","2":"Valeria","3":"On it."},{"T":"301","3":"Valeria leaps onto the street, rushing for the dissipating Murray."},{"T":"301","3":"But before her hand can reach Murray, he completely vanishes."},{"T":"301","2":"Bazhi","3":"...****."},{"T":"301","3":"Bazhi spits out an elegant pejorative, and rips her appendages out from the wall behind the false Murray, now full of holes."},{"T":"301","3":"Almost instantaneously, the Murray explodes before her."},{"T":"301","2":"Valeria","3":"Bazhi, what's happening?"},{"T":"301","2":"Bazhi","3":"Tch... It's a jamming smokescreen... Some dumb data weapon..."},{"T":"301","2":"Valeria","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Valeria","3":"What's going on?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Bazhi","3":"An area alarm... I see."},{"T":"301","2":"Valeria","3":"So that's what he had planned..."},{"T":"301","2":"Bazhi","3":"That low-level smokescreen won't do much, but it's enough to alert the termination programs in this virtual space."},{"T":"301","2":"Bazhi","3":"Tch, looks like they clean up everything with unknown IDs indiscriminately, which includes us."},{"T":"301","2":"Bazhi","3":"Whatever it is, we can only... leave now."},{"T":"301","2":"Valeria","3":"Yeah."}]
