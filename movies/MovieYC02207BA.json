[{"T":"301","3":"There is a slight gust of wind from the elevator shaft."},{"T":"301","3":"The steel frame creaks with the tension of the chain blade as a figure in the gray cloak slowly descends from above."},{"T":"301","3":"In one fluid motion, the figure gracefully lands on his feet without producing even the faintest of sounds. If there is stage and a spotlight, he must be the acrobat garnering all the attention of the crowd."},{"T":"301","3":"The figure walks down the intricate staircase with the familiarity of walking in one's home."},{"T":"301","3":"He takes off the hood that has been covering his head, shakes his messy long hair, and gives a curtain call to the petite figure sitting in the room."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Mission complete. Are you satisfied with my performance, miss?"},{"T":"301","2":"Cinderelik","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"I would appreciate it if you could make my exit more dignified."},{"T":"301","2":"Cinderelik","3":"With your ability, Roland, you can leave at any time without my help."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Sorry, I can't help making things more dramatic."},{"T":"301","2":"Cinderelik","3":"...Is that how it is? I see."},{"T":"301","3":"She gently nods in understanding, and casts her eyes back to the monitors."},{"T":"301","3":"This is the location closest to the CPF's centrifuge array as well as the central hub underground. The real 'Mother' grows and incubates here, so Cinderelik had transformed it into a greenhouse similar to the underground waterway."},{"T":"301","3":"A terminal composed of multiple monitors is pieced together in the center of the greenhouse. Each screen displays different images throughout the CPF."},{"T":"301","3":"The images contain entangled vines, damaged facilities, wandering Hetero-Creatures, and dead bodies quietly drying in the gaps between plants."},{"T":"301","3":"Most of the screens are static images. Only a few in the middle show signs of human activity."},{"T":"301","3":"The monitors constantly change as they follow the group's movements from different angles. A peculiar waveform accompanied with data is displayed in the upper right corner of each image."},{"T":"301","3":"As if confirming the changes of numbers and waveforms, the Hetero-Hive Mother separated by the glass on the other side occasionally sends out violent 'fetal movements.'"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Impressive... You've got quite the knack for capturing the perfect angle. If this was the Golden Age, I'm sure you'd win an award for best director."},{"T":"301","2":"Cinderelik","3":"Mother sees everything."},{"T":"301","2":"Cinderelik","3":"The entire CPF and even the surrounding forest have become an extension of its senses."},{"T":"301","3":"Cinderelik's eyes remain fixated on the flashing images and data on the screen."},{"T":"301","2":"Monitor Broadcast","3":"'Did Rolmo fall down the elevator?'"},{"T":"301","2":"Monitor Broadcast","3":"'...Into the elevator shaft. With all those strange plants, I'm afraid he's already...'"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Hah! Look. They're worried about me."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Looks like I've still got it in me."},{"T":"301","2":"Cinderelik","3":"Variables have been introduced into the experiment. Beginning observation."},{"T":"301","3":"In the gray surveillance video, the knotted branches suddenly split, and the red abscesses resemble gelatinous eyes. These exposed red spheres rotate from time to time among the branches, watching from the shadows everything happening inside the tower."},{"T":"301","2":"Cinderelik","3":"...These 'eyes' will relay what they see to Mother. Your mission is complete."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Will these 'guests' be helpful to your research?"},{"T":"301","2":"Cinderelik","3":"Mother's incubation rate has steadily increased due to the stimulation from outside the CPF and the changing mental state of the humans inside it."},{"T":"301","2":"Cinderelik","3":"The final transformation will complete in approximately 4 hours. After that, incubation will begin."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Now that we are almost done, I've got a question about this 'Mother'. What's going to hatch out of her?"},{"T":"301","2":"Cinderelik","3":"This is Gabriel's unfinished business. I don't fully understand it, but I will continue his research based on the information he left behind."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Gabriel... It's a pity that Alpha finally got the best of him. Even if his memory shell was more intact, I don't think it's possible to recover all the data."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"I watched his every move while he tinkered with those Hetero-Creatures. So I know the details of his experiment."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"I was thinking... If you tell me about 'Mother', I'll fill you in on the details."},{"T":"301","3":"Roland smiles and lifts his palms up in a gesture of sincerity."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"We're in this together, you know... I think it's a fair trade."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Speaking of which... I've seen Gabriel repair Hetero-Creatures broken beyond recognition. His skill and technology... really amazes me."},{"T":"301","3":"Cinderelik looks up at Roland. A touch of emotion flashes in her dark gold eyes."},{"T":"301","2":"Cinderelik","3":"Der Meister... told me a story."},{"T":"301","2":"Cinderelik","3":"A group of greedy adventurers awoke a slumbering demon while stealing the treasure in its lair underground. When the demon woke up, he saw that humans were weak and greedy, and decided to reshape the world..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Oh?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"I see. So these actors are playing the role of those 'adventurers.' Everything in this tower is a play for 'Mother', is that right?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"...As for me. I'm also an actor in this performance. Correct?"},{"T":"301","2":"Cinderelik","3":"Der Meister's exact words were, 'Let Mother witness humanity's potential.'"},{"T":"301","2":"Cinderelik","3":"He said you are the hunter now."},{"T":"301","3":"Roland pauses for a moment, then bursts out laughing."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Then I really need to thank him for looking at it from my perspective."},{"T":"301","2":"Cinderelik","3":"Perhaps it would be easier to just show you Gabriel's recordings."},{"T":"301","3":"No longer paying attention to Roland, Cinderelik reaches out to the terminal."},{"T":"301","3":"<<Interface Confirmation<< Data Recovery<<"},{"T":"301","3":"Complete<<Confirming Identification<<Complete"},{"T":"301","3":"Data generating.

Cinderelik will pick up where I left off."},{"T":"304","1":"After witnessing my body be dismantled once more, I suddenly came to understand that before I became a Ascendant..."},{"T":"304","1":"No, even before that... How to define data that has occupied this memory shell before gaining sentience..."},{"T":"304","1":"A bottle of alcohol broken over my body..."},{"T":"304","1":"A cigarette burning against my skin..."},{"T":"304","1":"As my head was trampled into the dirt repeatedly and I could only tremble in others' laughter... Something broke the shackles of my programming."},{"T":"304","1":"Helpless. Loathing. Unwilling. Insanity. Even now, these meaningless things occupy my neural circuit."},{"T":"304","1":"Useless memory data that had been deleted somehow finds its way back into my memory shell.

These are my last words."},{"T":"301","3":"The recording stops."},{"T":"301","3":"The rest is intermittent static."},{"T":"301","3":"The screen turns black. Only the red light indicating 'End' flashes in the dark, just like the red eyes under the mask of the crazed martyr who refused to stay down."},{"T":"301","3":"Cinderelik ends the broadcast with no expression on her face. Rather than watch the recording, she was staring at Roland's reaction silently."},{"T":"301","2":"Cinderelik","3":"This is all of the data Gabriel left behind."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Hmph... Stubborn bastard up until the very end."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"The real cumulation of the Punishing Virus's will? Seems like the things in this 'Mother' are far more troublesome than the Pterygota Queen."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Honestly, can't say I'm too fond of this."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Good thing Babylonia's got their hands full for the time being. Now's a good time to proceed with our work while they're distracted."},{"T":"301","3":"Roland seems to gloat at their misfortune, yet his narrowed gaze is like a surging undercurrent in the depths of a tranquil pool."},{"T":"301","2":"Cinderelik","3":"Now it's your turn to provide details on Gabriel's experiment not mentioned in the recordings."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Of course."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"I'm a man of my word."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Speaking of which, what were Gabriel's 'last words'?"},{"T":"301","3":"Cinderelik remains quiet as she opens another data file."},{"T":"301","3":"Gabriel's voice begins to play.
