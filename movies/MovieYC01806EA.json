However, several Corrupted use this opportunity to attack her."},{"T":"301","3":"Seeing the oncoming attack, Lucia leaps into the air and slices down through the approaching Corrupted. With the failure of the Corrupted's attack, Lee's gunfire penetrates their memory shells, giving them no further opportunity to attack."},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia kneels on the ground to stabilize her frame. All of the Corrupted that had attacked this area are now paralyzed at her feet."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Lee, 5 Corrupted are crawling on the ceiling at 10 o'clock."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"All clear."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Lee, behind you!"},{"T":"302","2":"(Punch)"},{"T":"301","3":"Lee dodges the incoming attack of a Corrupted arm severed by Lucia. Luckily, you are able to deflect it before it hits Liv, who is engaged in combat analysis behind you."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Hmm? Are you laughing, Commandant?"},{"T":"302","2":"Yeah."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"What are you so happy about?"},{"T":"302","2":"Just seems like we're beginning to act like a team."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Hmph... Enough with that."},{"T":"301","3":"Blades and bullets fly in the factory as Corrupted debris piles up behind."},{"T":"301","3":"As if aware of the incoming threat, the factory's assembly line begins to rapidly increase Corrupted production. A newly manufactured horde of Corrupted pours out like a flood of steel from the assembly line, destroying everything in their wake."},{"T":"302","2":"Stop them from spreading to other areas."},{"T":"301","3":"After receiving your order, Lucia and Lee rush forward and attempt to stop the massive horde of Corrupted, but a single team is powerless in their attempt to stymie the flood."},{"T":"301","3":"Before the Gray Ravens, the Corrupted quickly reduce in number as they surge in other directions."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Tsk."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"There's... too many. And they keep growing in number!"},{"T":"301","3":"Boom\u2014"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"What was that\u2014?!"},{"T":"301","3":"The Corrupted charging the Gray Ravens from the left side were suddenly vaporized by a white light."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Long-ranged support?"},{"T":"301","3":"Shortly after, another white column of light descends from the sky, swallowing all the operating machinery within the factory in a violent explosion. A wave of scalding machine parts falls at your feet."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"This landing point... No, this can't be!"},{"T":"302","2":"?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Commandant! Everyone!"},{"T":"301","3":"Liv calls out loudly and presses your shoulder firmly with her hand.

You temporarily feel suspended in space and time as the surrounding area is filled with white light."},{"T":"301","3":"The sudden bombing finally submerges the entire factory and everyone within."},{"T":"302","2":"..."},{"T":"302","2":"..."},{"T":"302","2":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"A mysterious cold breeze blows in through the neck of your damaged exoskeleton. The cold tingling sensation travels to your brain along the nervous system, awaking your dormant consciousness."},{"T":"302","2":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"Opening your eyes, you see that the white light had disappeared. The pink force field gradually dissipates, leaving the surrounding area shrouded in darkness."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Comm\u2014."},{"T":"302","2":"Who's..."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"\u2014!"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"\u3010kuroname\u3011!"},{"T":"302","2":"Who's calling me..."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Command\u2014!"},{"T":"302","2":"I'm..."},{"T":"302","2":"Here..."},{"T":"301","3":"In response to the call, you instinctively raise your right hand, but feel something hard."},{"T":"301","3":"Perhaps the sudden movement had caused the rock fragments near your hand to slide down with a clear and delicate clatter."},{"T":"302","2":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"A sudden beam of light pierces the darkness, illuminating your field of view. Finally, you see the anxious faces of Lee and Lucia standing before you."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Don't move. We're getting you out."},{"T":"302","2":"Lee..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Lee, looks like there's a support to the left of the commandant. Let's start from there."},{"T":"302","2":"...Lucia."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Commandant, we found you."},{"T":"302","2":"Ngh..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Alright. Liv could've done a better job, but it should suffice for the time being."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"The exoskeleton sure came in handy."},{"T":"301","3":"After Lee helps you with emergency first-aid, Lucia slowly helps you to your feet. After testing your legs, you find that you can still move."},{"T":"302","2":"Thanks."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Thank goodness\u2026"},{"T":"302","2":"Sorry for making you all worried..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"It's fine.

I'm upgrading the computing power of my SAR module."},{"T":"302","2":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"The three of you fall silent. All that remains of the factory is a disarray of ruins scattered throughout the surrounding area."},{"T":"301","3":"The towering buildings were flattened; the foundation blasted askew. Everyone knew that the chance of surviving such a bombing was grim."},{"T":"302","2":"Let's get moving. She may be trapped in the wreckage just like I was."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Got it."},{"T":"301","3":"Bang\u2014!"},{"T":"301","3":"Suddenly, a bullet hits the ground beside your foot, drawing everyone's attention.

You were behind all of those explosions."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"What?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Correct. An attack of this magnitude took a considerable amount of preparation."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"It shouldn't have been used here, but because of your mistakes, I had no choice but to use my precious orbital bombardment."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Hmph. You should thank me. After all, I cleaned up your mess before you could cause any irreparable damage."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"First, you don't thank me. Now, the three of you are looking at me in disgust."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Despicable. Teasell, Bambinata, stand in front of me so I don't have to see their repulsiveness."},{"T":"301","3":"The two Constructs beside Vanessa quietly step forward, separating you from her."},{"T":"302","2":"We can't find Liv because of your attack."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"So what?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Even if all of you died in the explosion... So what?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Sacrificing one squad to win the battle... Isn't that worth it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"What do you say, Teasell?"},{"T":"301","2":"Teasell","3":"...You're right."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Good..."},{"T":"301","3":"Vanessa smiles and slaps Teasell's handsome cheek with her other hand. He suddenly clenches his weapon, but quickly returns to normal before the others could notice."},{"T":"301","3":"Teasell's disheveled bangs obscure his gaze, hiding his expression."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Do you know why I hit you?"},{"T":"301","2":"Teasell","3":"No, I don't."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Tsk. Nothing seems to get through that handsome face of yours."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Bambinata, tell Teasell."},{"T":"301","2":"Bambinata","3":"Number one, Master's questions must be answered immediately. Number two, Master is always right."},{"T":"301","2":"Bambinata","3":"You hesitated, Teasell."},{"T":"301","2":"Teasell","3":"Apologies. I will be more attentive."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Very well!"},{"T":"301","3":"Vanessa smiles at Teasell's affirmation, then fixes his bangs."},{"T":"302","2":"No comrade should be sacrificed so carelessly."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"How cute of you to say that, Chief."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"What made you become like this? The Punishing Virus?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Oh, right. As your former classmate, I have a small suggestion."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Resign as a commandant. Leave the front line and never return."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"The battlefield isn't suitable for naive fools like you."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Deception, exploitation, abandonment... These are the laws of victory on the battlefield."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Stay in Babylonia. Work as a liaison officer or logistics personnel for Egret."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"You can also use Egret's resources that used to belong to Liv before we kicked her."},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Liv was as naive as you, so she was thrown away like an old doll."},{"T":"302","2":"Enough!"},{"T":"301","3":"Your hands begin to emit intense heat. The bandages wrapped by Liv had long been undone from the bombing. Blood flows down your arm, along your gun, and onto the ground."},{"T":"301","3":"The heat dissipation system running at the muzzle indicated that a bullet had been fired from the gun. At the other end of the trajectory stands your higher-up, Vanessa."}]
