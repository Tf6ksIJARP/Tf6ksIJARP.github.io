You..."},{"T":"301","3":"The sailor looks at you and pauses for a moment, but then decides to change to another subject."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"At first, I wasn't a sailor. Like I said, I was one of the many refugees who wanted to seek shelter."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"In the beginning, the evil dragon appeared on a plain. But then, it started to ravage and destroy the nearby villages. Many people fled out of fear."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"I followed the crowd and escaped from our village to the capital city. We didn't know what was hunting us. Perhaps it was a dragon, a monster, hunger, or our weary bodies. Or, we were simply out of hope...
