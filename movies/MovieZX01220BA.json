Since there are no passenger seats, the Forsaken are leaning against the walls to keep balance."},{"T":"301","3":"The door leading to the next carriage slowly opens, and out walks a girl holding a strange sign\u2014Sophia."},{"T":"301","2":"Sophia","3":"The next station is Kowloong Corp.

Are you announcing stops?"},{"T":"301","3":"Though astonished at such an ancient practice, Watanabe is well aware that the girl will keep on repeating the stop until he says something."},{"T":"301","2":"Sophia","3":"Yes, I am Sophia, and I will be your terminal attendant today. If you need anything, just let me know. A 50% surcharge will be applied to all goods and services."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"You sure know how to rip tourists off... Anyway, didn't know this train was staffed with terminal attendants. I thought your carriages were all installed with speakers to broadcast announcements."},{"T":"301","2":"Sophia","3":"We do, but Princess Jamilah said the Forsaken carriage should go low-power, so we turned it off."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Forsaken Soldier","3":"Mr. Watanabe, we're almost at our destination. What's the next move?"},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"Since we're a bit short on numbers, skirmishing would be the best course of action. After all, the intel report from Babylonia mentioned that the Corrupted are moving along a set route."},{"T":"301","2":"Forsaken Soldier","3":"...Understood, I'll spread the word."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"What's the plan on your end? You and that boy are the only combatants you've got, right?"},{"T":"301","2":"Sophia","3":"The two of us will be enough."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"That's some confidence right there. Anyway, as soon as the door opens, we Forsakens will jump off and intercept the enemy. Can you keep an eye on our luggage while we're gone?"},{"T":"301","2":"Sophia","3":"Okay, but we won't take responsibility for anything lost."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"Hah, shrewd... All personnel, get ready to jump off at the next turn. Our target is the marching Corrupted."},{"T":"301","2":"Forsaken Soldier","3":"Yes, sir!"}]
