Show me what's inside Santa's chocolate box\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"Roland looks at the gold-masked man.

What about mine?"},{"T":"301","3":"There is no need to think."},{"T":"301","3":"Roland feels the familiar yet strange world disappear around him. He sees a tight rope connecting him and fate."},{"T":"301","3":"Too easy. The choice is too easy."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"I hope you can lend me a hand when I'm in need, Sir."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"You won't lose anything."},{"T":"301","3":"Roland sees a trace of surprise in Vonnegut's eyes. He didn't expect such a request."},{"T":"301","3":"Out of the corner of his eye, Roland sees Cinderelik open her mouth, but Vonnegut dismisses her attempt."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"An interesting request. I cannot give you a guarantee, but you can look forward to it."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Luna's initial wish was to create a 'paradise she could live together with her sister.'"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"But as long as the Ascnet has a leash on her, Luna will never get what she really wants."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"I'll take it as a yes."},{"T":"301","3":"Too easy. Way too easy. Roland knows he will still be walking the tightrope in the days to come, but he will never say no to it."},{"T":"301","3":"Who cares about how much fate will ask for what it bestows?"},{"T":"301","3":"Roland finally understands what 'result' means.
