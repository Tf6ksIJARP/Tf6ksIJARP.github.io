Everyone is crowding around a few staff in yellow..."},{"T":"301","2":"Worker in Yellow A","3":"Stop pushing! You have to pass the test first! Pushing won't do you any good!"},{"T":"301","2":"Worker in Yellow B","3":"Yeah, you're not getting any food in your mouth if you don't know this carriage well enough!"},{"T":"301","3":"The uproarious crowd ignores the workers and keeps pushing forward. Seeing this scene, the aristocrats' bodyguards ready to pull out their guns any time."},{"T":"301","3":"That is when a tall and muscular man, who was also in a worker's uniform, pushes through the bodyguards and came forward."},{"T":"301","2":"Vigorous Male Voice","3":"What is the meaning of this? You lot can't even do something as simple as recruiting a new guy?"},{"T":"301","2":"Worker in Yellow A & B","3":"...Leader!"},{"T":"301","2":"Worker in Yellow A","3":"They wouldn't listen. They keep saying they don't care if they die tomorrow as long as they get to eat..."},{"T":"301","2":"Vigorous Male Voice","3":"Preposterous!"},{"T":"301","2":"Vigorous Male Voice","3":"What?! You don't care even if you'll die tomorrow?! Are your lives worth so little?!"},{"T":"301","3":"It may have been something in the man's vigorous voice, but the crowd immediately becomes silent."},{"T":"301","2":"Vigorous Male Voice","3":"You wanna eat under me? Get enough provisions to fill your stomachs every day? Sure!"},{"T":"301","2":"Vigorous Male Voice","3":"If you can answer my questions, I'll make sure you get that meal of yours!"},{"T":"301","2":"Vigorous Male Voice","3":"In the name of Andre Smirnov, the chief of the inspection team, I guarantee it."},{"T":"301","3":"People chattered among themselves in the crowd, and after around ten minutes, they became quiet once more."},{"T":"301","2":"Andre","3":"Good, at least you lot can still comprehend human speech."},{"T":"301","2":"Andre","3":"Now tell me, what am I holding here in my hand?"},{"T":"301","3":"Andre lifts up something that resembles a wrench in his hand. It looks a little different to a normal wrench."},{"T":"301","3":"After a few moments, people start shouting answers like 'wrench,' 'screwdriver,' and 'iron stick.'"},{"T":"301","2":"Andre","3":"Those who answered 'wrench' or 'ratchet wrench' can stay, the others can go home. Don't think you can fool me, I have exceptional hearing."},{"T":"301","3":"The crowd murmurs among themselves once more. Soon after, two-thirds of the people left, though it is not known if they believed what Andre said or were just merely afraid of the guns the bodyguards were holding."},{"T":"301","2":"Andre","3":"Next question, how many air conditioning systems and vents are in each commoner carriage?"},{"T":"301","3":"Andre is met with silence, with only an occasional few numbers being mumbled out."},{"T":"301","2":"Andre","3":"...Come on. If you don't know, you don't know."},{"T":"301","3":"The crowd becomes quiet once more."},{"T":"301","2":"Andre","3":"...Sorry, but I'm afraid you lot aren't worthy of the meal I provide.

You may all leave now."},{"T":"301","3":"The crowd hesitates for a while, but dissipates in the end."},{"T":"301","2":"Worker in Yellow A","3":"Chief, we're already short-staffed. We can't keep on like this..."},{"T":"301","2":"Andre","3":"That doesn't mean we can just hire those without basic knowledge, I'm not risking it, not even for light duty."},{"T":"301","2":"Worker in Yellow A","3":"But those aristocrats refuse to renew our equipment. They're so insatiable that we can all work ourselves to a pulp and still fail to satisfy them."},{"T":"301","2":"Andre","3":"There are still other carriages, right? Hopefully, we'll find someone who qualifies."},{"T":"301","3":"That is when Andre notices the skinny little girl standing in front of him."},{"T":"301","2":"Andre","3":"What's the matter? Inspection work is not for kids."},{"T":"301","2":"'Hyena'","3":"Each commoner carriage has four sets of air conditioning systems, and each system has 16 vents, equaling to a total of 64."},{"T":"301","2":"'Hyena'","3":"What you're holding is a 32-tooth NT64 ratchet wrench manufactured by Cosmos Industries."},{"T":"301","3":"Andre is surprised by the girl's answer."},{"T":"301","2":"Andre","3":"Looks like you know your stuff, shame that you're just a kid."},{"T":"301","2":"Andre","3":"How did you know that?"},{"T":"301","2":"'Hyena'","3":"I've been through each of the 64 vents."},{"T":"301","2":"Andre","3":"That's quite a claim you're making, even I can't say for sure I've been through every vent."},{"T":"301","2":"'Hyena'","3":"...You don't trust me."},{"T":"301","2":"Andre","3":"And why should I?

You guys have been trying to fix the gas backflow problem around here recently."},{"T":"301","2":"Andre","3":"Stop lying, we just changed the air duct of the 4th air conditioning system not long ago."},{"T":"301","2":"'Hyena'","3":"The air duct is undoubtedly new, and the problem did improve temporarily. But if you don't get rid of the rats in the filter box, then the problem will still persist when their excrement accumulate."},{"T":"301","2":"Andre","3":"...Caglia, go check it out."},{"T":"301","2":"Worker in Yellow A","3":"Sure, Chief."},{"T":"301","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Worker in Yellow A","3":"****, this is disgusting..."},{"T":"301","2":"Andre","3":"So?"},{"T":"301","2":"Worker in Yellow A","3":"Well, what she said is true, we had to dismantle the whole case to get rid of them."},{"T":"301","2":"Worker in Yellow A","3":"It'd take at least a week for us to find the problem, how in the world did she know?"},{"T":"301","3":"Andre glances at the rags 'Hyena' wears as clothes.
