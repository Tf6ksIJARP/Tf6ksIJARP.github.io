[{"T":"301","3":"Lee's blue figure passes through the dilapidated buildings. As he advances, each Corrupted on his way, without exception, is shot precisely through their memory shells by him."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Lee, you're moving too fast. The commandant and Liv don't have the same mobility as Attacker Constructs."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Don't overdo yourself if you can't keep up."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"But if you run into trouble, we won't be able to provide you with support."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Lucia, haven't you noticed that we're making faster progress than on previous missions?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"This isn't the first time the two of us Attacker Constructs are in each other's way on a mission together."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Um..."},{"T":"301","3":"Hearing Lucia on the comm link, Lee shows no sign of slowing down. Instead, he keeps his finger on the trigger. Lee flies among the Corrupted, leaving a trail of mechanical debris."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"I'm merely stating the facts. I have no malicious intent."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"And by the time you guys had reported in, I had already finished gathering intel on the enemy here on the streets."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"One Attacker Construct was all it took to wipe out the Corrupted around here."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"There's still a lot we don't know about the city. Assume echelon formation and alternate as point man. This will conserve energy consumption for each member."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"But..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"No buts. You haven't thought of a better solution. Have you?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"So, I'll be the first to take point..."},{"T":"301","3":"Lee's voice suddenly cuts out. Only static crackles over the comm link."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Lee?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"I've lost Lee's signal."},{"T":"302","2":"Prioritize clearing out enemies along the way to Lee's position."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Roger."},{"T":"301","3":"Everyone arrives at Lee's last known location, but Lee is still missing. Instead, you see a circular pit."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Lee?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Cough. Over here."},{"T":"301","3":"Lee's voice comes out from within the hole. As you approach, you see Lee lying there motionless."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Wait, I'll get you out of here."},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia extends her hand into the hole, but upon touching the edge of the pit, she suddenly retracts her hand as a dazzling electric light runs between the hole and Lucia's fingers."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"This is..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"It's an EMP trap. Ground forces used these against Corrupted."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"But they were later banned due to their inefficiency."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Exactly. The traps don't kill the enemy. Instead, the Corrupted can just overwhelm them with shear numbers."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Hmph. Humanities defenses are now hindering their own attack."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"How foolish."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Commandant, we've overstayed our welcome. A horde of Corrupted are advancing on our position."},{"T":"301","3":"Hearing this, Lucia tightens her grip on the katana, the pain of indecision tearing at her heart."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Go on. I can handle myself."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"I can't move my frame, but they won't break it so easily."},{"T":"302","2":"What do you think, Liv?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Evacuating is our best option. Minimizing losses would be more beneficial overall."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"This is the secret to Egret's repeated victories."},{"T":"302","2":"But we're the Gray Ravens."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"..."},{"T":"302","2":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Huh? Commandant, what are you doing?"},{"T":"301","3":"You pull out a tactical knife from your waistband and rope from your backpack. You fasten one end of the rope to the edge of the pit."},{"T":"301","3":"You tie the other end of the rope around your waist."},{"T":"302","2":"Doing my job."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Got it."},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia nods, then readies her katana and prepares for battle."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Lucia?"},{"T":"302","2":"We're the Gray Ravens. Do as you see fit."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"What's the hold up? According to my calculations, Corrupted will arrive in 30 seconds."},{"T":"301","3":"After fixing the rope, you reach into the pit. Unlike Lucia, touching the edge has no effect on you."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"..."},{"T":"302","2":"Seems like it's ineffective against humans."},{"T":"301","3":"Ensuring that there was no hindrance, you climb into the pit."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"What are you doing?"},{"T":"301","3":"Ignoring Lee's questioning, you rappel down the pit. Your army boots thud against the wall, echoing throughout the pit. A few moments later, you reach Lee lying there motionless at the bottom."},{"T":"301","3":"As you reach the bottom, you hear the clanging of a katana and buzzing electricity overhead."},{"T":"302","2":"Looks like they've engaged the enemy."},{"T":"301","3":"Kneeling down, you help Lee up and fasten him to your back with the rope."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Why are you being so foolish and reckless?"},{"T":"302","2":"You're in no condition to help yourself."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Laugh it up. No need to act like you're concerned. I've seen enough as is."},{"T":"302","2":"Looks like this trap can also temporarily short-circuit Constructs."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"..."},{"T":"302","2":"Good thing I was the first one into the pit and not a Corrupted."},{"T":"302","2":"Otherwise, you'd have been in trouble, Lee."},{"T":"301","3":"With Lee on your back, you tug on the rope to check that it is securely fastened and begin to slowly climb your way back up."},{"T":"301","3":"Severed Corrupted limbs fall into the pit as they become enveloped in blue static and crash into the bottom of the pit with a heavy thud."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"But now everyone is in danger because of me."},{"T":"302","2":"We've already made up our minds."},{"T":"302","2":"There will always come a time when you need someone's help."},{"T":"302","2":"Just like I said earlier. You should give it a try."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"...When I get back, the first thing I'm doing is give this frame EMP resistance."},{"T":"302","2":"Alright, alright."},{"T":"301","3":"Climbing out of the pit with Lee on your back, you see Lucia with her katana standing among Corrupted remains. The worn coating on her legs shows signs of an arduous fight defending this position."},{"T":"301","3":"Liv is sitting on the ground, struggling to catch her breath. Even her Levi-Gun lays motionless on the ground."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Commandant, Lee."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Thank goodness you're both alright."},{"T":"302","2":"Good thing we made it back."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"What a weird commandant."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Hey, Lee, why's your face turning red?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Hm?"},{"T":"301","3":"Hearing this, Lee can't help but touch his cheeks. He quickly turns his head to look the other way."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"The frame's heat dispersal is malfunctioning! Don't worry about it!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Malfunctioning heat dissipation may cause issues down the line. Liv, help out Lee..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"That won't be necessary!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"But..."},{"T":"302","2":"Heh."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Heh."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"?"}]
