Rather, it is a familiar sound she hears in the snowy forest."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"There you are."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Hurry, let's go back. It's too dangerous being here on the mountain in this kind of weather."},{"T":"301","3":"Rosetta quickly walks toward the CUB.

Where did I just come from?"},{"T":"301","3":"The blizzard has already covered her tracks. Any potential markers are lost in the flurry. Right now, they are surrounded by infinite darkness cast by the violent snowstorm."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Regardless, we have to get off the mountain first."},{"T":"301","3":"However, Rosetta stumbles onto the ground after just a few steps."},{"T":"301","3":"Even as a Construct, she finds that her mobility in such treacherous weather has become greatly hindered."},{"T":"301","3":"Rosetta tries to stand up with the help of her spear, but the snowstorm throws her to the ground once more."},{"T":"301","3":"But just as she is about to fall into the snow, a sturdy strength suddenly rises from beneath her."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"What are you..."},{"T":"301","3":"Without receiving any orders, the CUB catches her fall and tosses her on its back."},{"T":"301","3":"This sudden move, however, causes Rosetta's spear to collide with the CUB's body."},{"T":"301","3":"Despite receiving quite a number of scratches from the spear, the CUB pays no mind.

Rosetta has to feel her way through the darkness alone."},{"T":"301","3":"Rosetta always knows that she does not have the best luck."},{"T":"301","3":"She brings trouble and misfortune to her comrades. If her comrades continue onward with her, they will only be met with pain."},{"T":"301","3":"That was why she chose to face Alpha by herself back then.

We'll both get caught in the avalanche!"},{"T":"301","3":"Rosetta tries to jump again\u2014only to be stopped by the CUB once more.

Rosetta sits up and looks back to see the avalanche continuing to surge down the cliff. The CUB gently rears up on its hind legs, then continues down the mountain."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"We made it out all thanks to you."},{"T":"301","3":"Hearing this, the CUB shakes its head."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"You mean... it wasn't just you?"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"You and I... together?"},{"T":"301","3":"The CUB refrains from answering and continues onward silently.
