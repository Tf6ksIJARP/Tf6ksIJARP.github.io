That means the prosecuted engineers and so on were basically all scapegoats."},{"T":"301","2":"Atiel","3":"While the ones in the know, the ones that decided to hide Amberia... They all got off scot-free and kept this a secret until now."},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"While getting ready for the lab expedition, Simon has been meticulously analyzing the available information. Diana is silent, her eyes glazing off into the distance."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Commandant, while we have the time, let me perform maintenance on your Polar Soldier."},{"T":"302","2":"You know how to?","4":"You're not checking on Diana?"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Just a little. Sometimes the kids will play with them while the fishermen aren't looking."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"To the Forest Guards, this place is the beginning and the end. There's no need to worry about Diana. She can handle herself."},{"T":"301","3":"With that, Rosetta deactivates her levitational modules and half-kneels in the snow. She carefully goes through the joints and welded plates laboriously, leaving not even a single scratch unchecked."},{"T":"301","2":"Atiel","3":"You sure are amazing, Rosetta. Not only can you fight, you're also quite the skilled mechanic."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"What can I say? I'm just trying my best."},{"T":"301","2":"Atiel","3":"It's more than that.
