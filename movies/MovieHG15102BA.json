[{"T":"301","3":"3:15 p.m. Combat Drill Training Lobby, Command Central Building"},{"T":"301","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"Due to it being a holiday, the Combat Drill Training Lobby is emptier than usual."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Whew... Commandant!"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"I made the adjustments according to your request. Come check it out!"},{"T":"302","2":"You worked hard.","4":"Thank you."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"I sneaked out without Captain noticing! How was that, huh?"},{"T":"302","2":"(Check the database)"},{"T":"301","3":"Kamui is gazing in your direction, eyes bright. Always eager for compliments after completing a mission\u2014just how Kamui is."},{"T":"302","2":"I don't see any problems.","4":"Well done."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Aw... and yet Captain never trusts me with the testing! I did just fine. Even you're saying so, Commandant!"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Anyway, if there's nothing else you need me for, I'll be off."},{"T":"302","2":"You're not staying a little longer?"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"I do want to hang out with you, Commandant... but Captain's gonna bombard me with messages for sure!"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Wait... Ooh, are you flustered?"},{"T":"302","2":"Why would I be flustered?","4":"Not at all."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"There's no need to be flustered! I've spent lots of time with Camu. He's not as terrifying as he looks. Quite cute, actually!"},{"T":"302","2":"Cute...?","4":"Didn't he almost kill you?"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"I rubbed off on him, of course, after all the time we spent together. Besides, you're good at discovering the cute sides of others. It's a specialty of yours!"},{"T":"302","2":"That's an exaggeration!","4":"Are you sure that's not a compliment for yourself?"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"He's a bit direct, that's all. Besides, I won in the end, because I had you on my side. So you should trust in yourself!"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Anyway, I don't plan to see that guy again. It was annoying enough already having him watching my every move! From now on he'll be watching YOUR every move instead, Commandant."},{"T":"302","2":"Kamui..."},{"T":"301","3":"Ignoring your comment, the blond Construct sticks out his tongue and runs off."},{"T":"301","3":"As far as you can remember, Kamui has been acting like this ever since Camu returned. He is dedicated in helping Camu with his training, yet acts all nonchalant."},{"T":"302","2":"(He's probably being considerate towards Camu.)"},{"T":"301","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Hey."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Hey!"},{"T":"302","2":"Hey.","4":"Huh?"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Aren't you the one who told me to come? Why are you zoning out?"},{"T":"301","3":"Camu looks a bit annoyed."},{"T":"302","2":"I knew you'd come.","4":"I thought you wouldn't come."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Didn't you say you'd wait here?"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"I was just checking to see if you're really waiting here like you said."},{"T":"302","2":"Take this."},{"T":"301","3":"Camu pulls a hand out of his pocket and catches the item you toss him."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"What's that?"},{"T":"302","2":"The adjusted simulation data."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Adjusted? You mean from the previous battle?"},{"T":"302","2":"Yes.","4":"For reconstructing the scene in the sim mission."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"You want to hold the simulated mission again or something?"},{"T":"302","2":"I want to reconstruct the scene."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Didn't the Council tell you to stop with that kind of training?"},{"T":"302","2":"Adjustments have been done, though.","4":"I have my reasons."},{"T":"301","3":"Camu gazes at you with a suspicious frown, but accepts the explanation."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"...If you say so."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"However, I need to remind you that, if another accident like that one happens, I'm not taking any responsibility."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"You asked for this. Not my fault if they lose a precious commandant of theirs."},{"T":"302","2":"No need to worry."},{"T":"301","3":"Minutes later, Camu is standing back in the corridor once more, just like the scene a few days ago."},{"T":"301","3":"The deeper he goes, the tenser Camu gets."},{"T":"302","2":"Camu."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"...Hm? What?"},{"T":"302","2":"I need your help."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Help with what?"},{"T":"301","3":"With Kamui's help plus countless reviews, this mission seems to be going much smoother than the last time."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Hah... hah..."},{"T":"301","3":"The opponent with Roland's appearance has dissipated into shards of light, scattered on the ground. The corridor is soon devoured by darkness again."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"I... d-did it..."},{"T":"301","3":"Suddenly realizing that he is stuttering, Camu clears his throat and straightens up. The holographic battlefield in the simulated mission fades away, revealing the training pod."},{"T":"302","2":"It worked.","4":"Pretty good, wasn't it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"What did you do?"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Yeah. What did you do?"},{"T":"302","2":"Kamui helped a lot."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Oh. Is that so?"},{"T":"302","2":"(Let's change the topic)","4":"How are you and Kamui getting along?"},{"T":"301","3":"Camu tuts, as if seeing right through your hesitation. He's surprisingly astute in certain situations, much like Kamui."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"No need to treat me like a porcelain doll. It's stupid."},{"T":"301","3":"Camu seems a bit surprised by the direct question."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"...I know how to deal with Kamui. No need to worry about that."},{"T":"301","3":"As he speaks however, he stares off into the distance at a spot outside the sleeping pod."},{"T":"302","2":"(He doesn't seem ready...)","4":"Okay, got it."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"What are you looking at me like that for?"},{"T":"302","2":"Nothing.","4":"There's something on your face."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Huh...? Really? Are you kidding me?"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"If you're poking fun at me, I'll kill you\u2014"},{"T":"302","2":"You're so mean!"},{"T":"301","3":"Camu seems to relax a little at your response."},{"T":"302","2":"I'll get ready."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Hurry, then, don't make me wait."},{"T":"301","2":"Unfamiliar Commandant","3":"Hey! Watch your attitude! You're not a regular Construct, huh?"},{"T":"301","2":"Support Construct","3":"Commandant, this certainly isn't an ordinary Construct."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"What does that have to do with you?"},{"T":"301","2":"Attacker Construct","3":"...Ah. So it's really true that Gray Raven's experimenting with the Corrupted\u2014"},{"T":"301","2":"Support Construct","3":"S-Siren, don't say that!"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Who are you calling a Corrupted now? Don't compare me to those low-lifes!"},{"T":"301","2":"Unfamiliar Commandant","3":"Ahem... No matter what you are... we can't have a test subject roam free out here, can we?"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"If your mouth is incapable of spouting anything nice, shall I fix it for you?"},{"T":"301","3":"This is what comes into sight after you get ready and exit the training grounds."},{"T":"301","3":"Camu is standing off with several others, one of them in a commandant uniform. Looks like some sort of conflict is going on."},{"T":"302","2":"What's going on?","4":"(Stay quiet)"},{"T":"301","2":"Unfamiliar Commandant","3":"You're in charge of this guy, yeah? He didn't even apologize after bumping into us. Are you not gonna do anything about that?"},{"T":"301","2":"Unfamiliar Commandant","3":"Hey, you! Aren't you the Gray Raven Commandant? You're in charge of this guy, yeah? He didn't even apologize after bumping into us. Are you not gonna do anything about that?"},{"T":"302","2":"Please be careful with your words."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"...You want me to be careful with my words?"},{"T":"301","2":"Unfamiliar Commandant","3":"Duh. The mere existence of aggressive dudes like you is the reason why humans are constantly at war. Now apologize\u2014"},{"T":"302","2":"I mean I want YOU to be careful with your words."},{"T":"301","2":"Unfamiliar Commandant","3":"\u2014And rethink your entire life\u2014Who, me? But he's the one who offended us first!"},{"T":"301","2":"Support Construct","3":"We didn't do a thing. He was the one who started it! So we should just shut up and let him attack us, huh?"},{"T":"301","2":"Attacker Construct","3":"Besides, he IS a Corrupted. He moves freely despite the virus and can even infect others. Shouldn't you be held accountable for letting a dangerous being like this out here?"},{"T":"302","2":"He's not a Corrupted","4":"I apologize."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Say that again! I dare you!"},{"T":"302","2":"Oh no.","4":"Camu!"},{"T":"301","3":"Camu swings his fist and punches the commandant square in the face."},{"T":"301","2":"Unfamiliar Commandant","3":"Ugh! You\u2014"},{"T":"301","2":"Support Construct","3":"C-Commandant! You're bleeding!"},{"T":"301","2":"Tank-type Construct","3":"How dare you? Don't you know Constructs aren't allowed to harm humans in Babylonia?"},{"T":"301","3":"The gigantic Armor-Type Construct slams Camu into the wall, making a loud metallic clang."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Do you really think the Babylonia rules apply to me? Say one more word and I'll rip you apart!"},{"T":"301","3":"Camu roars and grabs the tall, broad tank-type Construct. He shoves him into the ground and starts throwing punches relentlessly."},{"T":"302","2":"Stop it, Camu!"},{"T":"301","2":"Unfamiliar Commandant","3":"How dare you harm my team members?"},{"T":"301","3":"Camu simply grabs both of them, one with each hand. Everything immediately descends into chaos."},{"T":"301","2":"Attacker Construct","3":"L-Let go of my commandant if you don't want to be blasted apart by my rockets!"},{"T":"301","2":"Support Construct","3":"Hey! Somebody help!"},{"T":"301","3":"Amidst the chaos, you try to step between the two sides, but is sent flying to the ground by a punch\u2014you are not even sure by whom."},{"T":"301","3":"All of a sudden, all you can hear is screaming and punches being thrown."},{"T":"302","2":"(Protect yourself)","4":"(Help Camu and attack the enemies)"},{"T":"301","3":"You protect your head with your arms, while your whole frame feels like it's about to fall apart."},{"T":"301","2":"System Voice","3":"Warning... warning..."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Stop right there! Capture them all!"},{"T":"301","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"As the commotion goes on, you are pulled to the side. With your blurred vision, you see Camu stopping a fist being swung in your direction."},{"T":"301","3":"The two men are panting hard, glaring at each other."},{"T":"301","2":"Guard Captain","3":"Enough! Stop this nonsense before I make you!"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"Camu snorts, knocks his opponent's fist out of the way and steps back."},{"T":"301","3":"While his opponent is wounded way more seriously, your face is also aching and swollen."},{"T":"301","2":"Guard Captain","3":"I don't care what your reason is\u2014all who violate the Babylonia Code of Conduct by fighting in public shall be punished. Come with me!"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"I started it."},{"T":"302","2":"Camu\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"Before you can finish, Camu is already striding off towards the guard. He whispers as he passes by you:"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"I'm a monster, huh?"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"I disappointed you. But I'm not sorry about it."},{"T":"302","2":"I don't think you're a monster."},{"T":"301","3":"Camu simply ignores your reply and speaks up, bringing an end to this fiasco."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Hey! I started it."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"But it was because he called me a Corrupted. So that's how Babylonia's gonna treat me for staying and helping, huh?"},{"T":"302","2":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"The Guard Captain seems to know a thing or two about this. He scratches his chin, as if troubled."},{"T":"301","2":"Guard Captain","3":"Who's in charge of\u2014"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"I don't answer to anyone."},{"T":"301","2":"Unfamiliar Commandant","3":"What a jerk!"},{"T":"301","2":"Guard Captain","3":"...No more excuses. Come with me, both of you!"},{"T":"301","2":"Guard Captain","3":"Commandant, please leave if this has nothing to do with you. Stay out of rotten businesses like this."},{"T":"301","3":"Seething from the comment, you throw yourself upon the Construct and swing a fist at him."},{"T":"301","3":"While your human fists cannot really hurt the metal Constructs much, you still manage to knock the opponent back a little."},{"T":"301","2":"System Voice","3":"Warning... warning..."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Stop right there! Capture them all!"},{"T":"301","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"As the commotion goes on, you are pulled to the side.

Come with me!"},{"T":"301","3":"Without missing a beat, Camu steps in front of you."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Hey, Guard Captain! I have a complaint to make."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"You Babylonians are the ones who asked me to stay and help, aren't you? And yet you're letting this impudent fool call me names?"},{"T":"301","2":"Guard Captain","3":"Uh..."},{"T":"301","3":"The Guard Captain seems to know a thing or two about this.

I'd rather not spend another second here with this imbecile."},{"T":"301","2":"Unfamiliar Commandant","3":"What a jerk!"},{"T":"301","3":"The Guard Captain stares at Camu, then at you. It is hard to tell if he realizes what is happening, but either way he is choosing to play dumb."},{"T":"301","2":"Guard Captain","3":"No more excuses. Come with me, both of you!"},{"T":"301","2":"Guard Captain","3":"Commandant, please leave if this has nothing to do with you. Stay out of rotten businesses like this."},{"T":"302","2":"Okay","4":"But I actually\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"Before you can finish, Camu is already striding off towards the guard. He whispers as he passes by you:"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"I don't want to bring more trouble to the Commandant of Gray Raven."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Just leave me alone."},{"T":"302","2":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"You find words stuck in your throat as the guards take Camu away.
