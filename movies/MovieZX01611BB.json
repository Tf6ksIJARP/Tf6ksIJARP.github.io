Don't worry about it for now."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"You disengaged from the virtual space too abruptly, preventing the Spear of F.O.S. from shutting down in time, leaving the real-time virtual spatial data generation in your cognitions."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Generally speaking, it shouldn't be too much of a hindrance. You would've made a full recovery after a few days of rest in the infirmary. But time is of the essence, and I think we can use it to our advantage."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"I'm going to try to upload the Spear of F.O.S. to your command link to synchronize it with your senses. This should allow you to restore, record, and playback the spatial data that you find."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"...In other words, you can connect to Gestalt's massive computing power with a security device, allowing you to perceive and analyze scenarios, connect with entire systems, even restore and simulate past events."},{"T":"302","2":"We can restore anything we want?"},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"As long as there is fragmented data nearby, you can use Gestalt to restore it."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Including data that has nothing to do with leads?"},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"You can use key data from people and objects to display the information in the area.

However, you must acquire the data first."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"By the way, since most people have been dispatched to the surface, Babylonia is now short-handed. A new liaison officer will take over for now. Also..."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Wait, I'll connect you to him."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"...It seems that we will maintain this perspective until the end of this mission."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"That's not too bad.
