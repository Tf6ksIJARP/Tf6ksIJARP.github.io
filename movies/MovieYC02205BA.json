[{"T":"304","1":"Recording:"},{"T":"304","1":"The impact from the orbital strike has greatly reduced the coverage and concentration of the Red Tide."},{"T":"304","1":"But these losses are negligible because 'that thing' has appeared deep beneath the scorched earth."},{"T":"304","1":"The impact of discovering such a thing is no less than the moment I found the Hetero-Core. At first, I didn't even fully comprehend what 'that thing' was."},{"T":"304","1":"It's like a revelation, an affirmation of my long persistence."},{"T":"304","1":"Although it shares the same characteristics as the Hetero-Creature incubators, it must be completely different inside. I call it the 'Mother'."},{"T":"304","1":"It seems that 'der Meister' is very interested in this new discovery. As one of the rewards for trading with him, I got a helpful assistant."},{"T":"304","1":"She has a keen knowledge of Hetero-Creatures and is an intelligent candidate for ascension."},{"T":"304","1":"Using her intellect, I found an incubation method to ensure that 'Mother' can unleash its full power."},{"T":"304","1":"Cinderelik calls it 'maternal love'\u2014the protective instinct of human mothers toward their children. She then implanted this data into 'Mother'..."},{"T":"304","1":"'Mother' has been an excellent incubator. It seems human emotions aren't completely useless. Maybe my previous directions were mistaken."},{"T":"304","1":"For this reason, I am simulating a special intervention to observe how 'emotion' will affect 'Mother' internally."},{"T":"304","1":"Unfortunately, I do not understand 'emotions.' The data provided by Cinderelik is too unitary. I need more human specimens."},{"T":"304","1":"\u2014Intact low-risk human specimens must be introduced into the area where the test subject is located through non-combative means."},{"T":"304","1":"This is no easy feat. Besides, the surrounding area has been scorched by the orbital strike. As a result, humans avoid the area out of fear."},{"T":"304","1":"I must admit, Roland is far more capable in this regard."},{"T":"304","1":"It's a pity that after the battle with the Polyphage, I lost contact with Roland. I presume he has already become nourishment for the Red Tide."},{"T":"304","1":"It seems that this experiment can only be carried out where the 'Highly Differentiated Unit' is located."},{"T":"304","1":"I released rumors to lure people to Pulia by taking advantage of humans' desire for gains. Just like how I spread the Red Tide's 'Gospel'."},{"T":"304","1":"Let these humans who are still struggling on Earth today witness the will of the Punishing Virus."},{"T":"301","3":"Having made their way into the exposed ventilation duct, the Scavengers are crawling slowly inside the narrow and dark space."},{"T":"301","3":"After following Rolmo around and around for the umpteenth time, they finally find their way out of the ventilation duct."},{"T":"301","3":"Flickers of daylight shine through the dome. It's the only source of light inside this giant tower."},{"T":"301","3":"This magnificent facility, left behind since the time of the Great Evacuation, also falls victim to the ravages of nature."},{"T":"301","3":"Soft, moist grass covers the connecting passages. Vines and branches get all tangled up between the iron walls and staircases, opening the doors originally used to seal off the mysterious chambers and growing all the way up from the very bottom of the tower."},{"T":"301","3":"The Scavengers immediately see the boxes scattered across the bottom level. They bear the World Government icon."},{"T":"301","2":"Beardy","3":"Over there! Supply crates!"},{"T":"301","3":"The stairs down were destroyed by overgrowth, so they have to cling to the edge and gradually climb down using the bare vines."},{"T":"301","3":"Right as 'Beardy' is about to reach the bottom, the vine snaps under his weight, causing him to fall to the ground with a heavy thud."},{"T":"301","3":"The broken vine begins to writhe like a worm. Suddenly, the red plant rapidly regenerates from the severed vine. Convulsing momentarily, the green cuticle covers the entire branch again."},{"T":"301","3":"Compared with the branches of ordinary vines or plants, this weird twisted thing is more like the tentacle of a mollusk."},{"T":"301","3":"Beardy screams and dumps the plant in his hand. He quickly takes out the gun that has been hanging on the side of his bag."},{"T":"301","2":"Beardy","3":"What the hell is this thing?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Kordes","3":"Seems like the vine has mutated, just like the plants in the forest."},{"T":"301","2":"Kordes","3":"If their suspicions are correct, destroying it will only increase the Punishing concentration, just like those monsters."},{"T":"301","2":"Beardy","3":"First Corrupted, now... I've had enough."},{"T":"301","2":"Zack","3":"Rolmo."},{"T":"301","2":"Rolmo","3":"Yeah? I'm here."},{"T":"301","2":"Zack","3":"Are there any of the monsters we saw in the tower, too?"},{"T":"301","2":"Rolmo","3":"I... I don't know..."},{"T":"301","2":"Zack","3":"If I find out you're lying..."},{"T":"301","2":"Beardy","3":"Shush\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"'Beardy', who was already leading the way over to the supply crate, suddenly turns around and gestures to be silent."},{"T":"301","2":"'Beardy'","3":"Quiet. Looks like we're not alone here."},{"T":"301","3":"'Beardy' walks around the pile of supply crates and discovers a person quietly sitting in the corner behind the crates."},{"T":"301","3":"Or rather, it wasn't a 'person.'"},{"T":"301","2":"Kordes","3":"...It's dead."},{"T":"301","3":"The corpse is leaned up against an empty supply crate. Its skull had been pierced by a branch, and its mouth hangs motionlessly agape."},{"T":"301","3":"Its decayed hands were in an empty grip, as if they were holding something tightly before they died. Scarlet plant branches entwine around its body, almost assimilating it with the surrounding environment."},{"T":"301","3":"The group falls silent at the horrific sight. 'Beardy' curses, then walks up to the body."},{"T":"301","2":"Kordes","3":"Hey! Watch out for the plants!"},{"T":"301","3":"Beardy replies. He keeps a distance and pokes the corpse as well as the plants around it with his gun, then backs off quickly."},{"T":"301","2":"Beardy","3":"It's okay. It's not moving."},{"T":"301","3":"Confirming that the plants won't ambush them, 'Beardy' kneels down next to the corpse and expertly pats it down, looking for anything useful."},{"T":"301","3":"Not finding anything, 'Beardy' turns over the backpack that fell to the side, then shakes his head and throws it back."},{"T":"301","3":"The unidentifiable corpse has nothing that can be deemed 'useful.'"},{"T":"301","2":"'Beardy'","3":"Nothing. Looks like there've been at least three other groups that came here before us."},{"T":"301","3":"He points at the bullet marks on the supply crates and grins."},{"T":"301","2":"Beardy","3":"I see three different kinds of bullet holes, new and old. Looks like there was a firefight here. This unlucky bastard didn't make it out."},{"T":"301","2":"'Beardy'","3":"Check the area. See if we can turn up anything useful. We can't go home empty-handed."},{"T":"301","3":"The other three nod. Readying their weapons, they spread out in opposite directions without having to say another word."},{"T":"301","2":"Kordes","3":"...Huh. A book."},{"T":"301","3":"Kordes stops in front of an unlucky corpse. He bends down to pick up a book that appears to have fallen out of his hand. He carefully turns the crisp paper. The sallow pages are stained with oxidized blood."},{"T":"301","2":"Kordes","3":"Looks like a religious text..."},{"T":"301","2":"Kordes","3":"The Story of Genesis, Eden, the Tree of Life\u2014"},{"T":"301","2":"Beardy","3":"Why are you always so obsessed with weird stuff?"},{"T":"301","2":"Zack","3":"Take only the things that are really useful, Kordes. Don't forget our rules."},{"T":"301","2":"Kordes","3":"...I know."},{"T":"301","2":"Kordes","3":"This area's clear. I didn't find anything. How about you guys?"},{"T":"301","2":"'Beardy'","3":"I found two boxes of military rations and one box of pistol ammo. Looks like they belonged to the ground troops. They were hidden out of sight. I almost missed them."},{"T":"301","2":"Beardy","3":"Zack, see something?"},{"T":"301","3":"Zack remains quiet. He doesn't appear to hear what 'Beardy' had said. He just stares at a spot on the tower."},{"T":"301","2":"'Beardy'","3":"Zack? You okay? See something?"},{"T":"301","3":"Only until 'Beardy' walks up to him and pats him does he slowly turn his head. His face contorts into a strange expression as he points to the area he had been observing."},{"T":"301","3":"That's the ventilation facility at the bottom of the tower, which hasn't been damaged by branches and vines yet. The tangled-up vines find their way around the fan blades on all the vents."},{"T":"301","3":"A gust of wind is coming from the depths of the vents, and along with it comes the noise of some large operating Mechanoid. The sound is a rhythmic beat, reminiscent of a heartbeat."},{"T":"301","2":"Zack","3":"If I'm not mistaken..."},{"T":"301","2":"Zack","3":"It's barely noticeable, but..."},{"T":"301","2":"Zack","3":"I think the tower... is still in operation."}]
