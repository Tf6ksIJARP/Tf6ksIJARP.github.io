You're not really trying to kill me, now, are you?"},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"...Hmph."},{"T":"301","3":"Seeing that Gabriel has withdrawn his hostility, Roland becomes his usual self once again, standing up and wiping off the dirt on his shoulder nonchalantly."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"You're too stiff for the ladies, you know? And I don't mean it as a compliment."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Not my concern."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Not even when it's our dear Miss Luna?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Frankly, you really should take a lesson on the art of conversation. Even the Babylonians can't resist when I turn up the charm\u2014they always listen to everything I have to say."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Wield it properly, and your tongue can be plenty mighty."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Excuses for the incompetent. You never were familiar with the concept of humility."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"I'm flattered."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"To tell you the truth, I always take you as quite an eccentric individual, but I'm not even remotely close, am I?"},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"...When an agent of the Ascension-Network goes astray, it is our duty as an Ascendant to correct them."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Words of a trusted advisor. Luna must be pleased to know how loyal you are to the Ascnet."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"That said, she never does anything without her reasons. Have you thought about the consequences of questioning her?"},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Have you?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"I believe in Luna."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Believe, or fear?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Where were you after what happened in Asslam and Venus Splash Park?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Searching for new 'preys,' as usual.

You cannot conceal it even if you try."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"...Fine."},{"T":"301","3":"Roland takes out an old hard drive from his windbreaker and throws it toward Gabriel. It glides in a slight arc before Gabriel snaps it out of the air."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Watch it! I didn't make backups."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"What is in it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Nothing of significance, compared to all the researches done by Shome."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"But... it's better than nothing."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Luna didn't seem very pleased with Shome's results. I wanted to find out what she's really after."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"And if what she's seeking contradicts the ideals of the Ascension-Network..."},{"T":"301","3":"Roland quiets down. Having heard what he said, Gabriel turns to stare at him, the uncomfortable silence between them spreading and festering."},{"T":"301","3":"Eventually, Roland shrugs."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"By the way, what are you planning to do with the Core we got?"},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"I have my plans."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"...Follow me, if you want to know."},{"T":"301","3":"With that, Gabriel turns around and departs, leaving Roland behind. Roland tracks Gabriel's silhouette with his eyes, his signature smile receded."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Well... Fun's over."},{"T":"301","3":"The red mud enveloping the Hetero-Core stirs and brews, reaching out and touching Gabriel's feet as he walks past, acting chaotic yet docile."},{"T":"301","3":"In this pool of blood-red mess, something begins to emerge, then crumples, before reforging itself into a new form."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Looking good, not bad."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"So what's the difference between this fella and your little pets? It keeps reshaping itself."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"The Hetero-Core you asked about is inside there. Unlike the inferior Rail Heterozygote, this will evolve into the most advanced being that the Punishing Virus has ever touched."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"What you are seeing is it searching for its most efficient, potent form. Only through destruction can it be reborn into a superior vessel."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Just like... Miss Luna."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Oh, how our grand vision has come to an impasse."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"You are right about one thing. Miss Luna has not been acting like herself lately."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"She has become content with the status quo. That is not the behavior of a respectable agent of the Ascension-Network."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"To Ascendants, staying put is no different from regression. A sure path to self-annihilation."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Which is why we require a motivator, something to rekindle her appreciation of her grand mission."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"With this?"},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"The strength I have been seeking, the most pure form of power, might just lie within."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Perhaps if I follow this path, it will not be long before I come across the answer I am looking for. And then..."},{"T":"301","3":"Gabriel does not continue his speech. His eyes fixate on the 'creature' in front of him, repeating the cycle of decimation and rebirth."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Out of curiosity, does Alpha know what you're doing?"},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"She will when the time is right. Now is not it."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Her perspective is still too shallow, having yet to understand what the Ascension-Network truly means. Miss Luna has never imparted those lessons."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"It's her long-lost sister, after all. Offering connections instead of burdens sounds like what Luna would do."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"But if such pointless sentiments have wavered her will as an agent, she will require correction."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"There is no price I would not pay for the future of the Ascension-Network."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"What a sight to see you agitated."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"For the Ascension-Network."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Fine, then. I'll take care of Alpha, and you do what you have to do."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Hopefully... it all goes according to plan."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"We can now be certain that the 'Red Tide' is connected to the Ascendants. The way they exploited the Hetero-Core..."},{"T":"302","2":"The Hetero-Creatures must also be their works."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"I have analyzed the data from our battles and found biological traits in all our enemies. From their looks to their behaviors, it is as if... they were mimicking the evolution of early earthborn creatures."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"If we consider the 'Red Tide' as the ocean of a young Earth, the Hetero-Creatures would be the growing species in the sea."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"While we can't confirm the exact time when the tide and the creatures came into existence, it's apparent that it must be after the Hetero-Core fell."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"The rate they're evolving... If it isn't their creator's intent but their own volition, then they will be far worse enemies than the Corrupted."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...And maybe someday they'll think like humans?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Only time will tell."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"At least the rate they're evolving is still\u2014hold on."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"The large Hetero-Creature signature we detected before we went underground...

I think we've stumbled upon where the Ascendants hide their secrets."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"The 'creature' Gabriel was developing in the replay has to be connected with the large Hetero-Creature. I'm starting to feel like everything's been going too smoothly..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Even if it's a trap, the casualty from the Red Tide is already too high. If this creature's let loose..."},{"T":"302","2":"We have to stop it here.","4":"We need more concrete intel."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"You're right. No time to hesitate."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Another thing that concerns me...

We'll have your back."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Everyone..."},{"T":"302","2":"Just like how you've always had ours."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...I understand. Thank you, Commandant."},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia looks down at her sword-wielding right hand. She tightens her fist, slowly and firmly, the way one would hold onto something dear."},{"T":"301","3":"By her side are companions who will always support her, and the commandant who unconditionally believes her."},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia is who she is now because of what you have all been through."},{"T":"301","3":"But Luna... has been alone since back then."}]
