[{"T":"301","3":"The minimalist tavern Changyu chose is a little ragged but well-supplied. With the token he stole, Changyu has no trouble getting into a place of this caliber to rent a room. A simple one, to avoid attention."},{"T":"301","3":"Right now, he is sitting by the bed cross-legged, listening to the singing outside. The antique television in the room is playing movies of generations past, and the moonlight has tainted Changyu's shadow blue."},{"T":"301","3":"Someone opens the door to the room."},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"I'm back. Which one do you want, Shacha noodles or wonton noodles?"},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"Wonton noodles!"},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"That's what Uncle Fu thought, so it comes with extra sauce.

Tell me your biggest wish in five seconds!"},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"Now, I wish tomorrow was the Dragon Boat Festival, then we could go get rice dumplings at Uncle Fu's. His dumplings are the absolute best in the world! You haven't really lived until you've tried one."},{"T":"301","2":"Huainan","3":"That's it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"Sure. I mean, I also hope that everything goes well tomorrow night at the Trade Fair...

Whether it's those rich assholes or those exploitative merchants... Bad people always come with bad karma."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"I've seen so many of them on this shitty boat\u2014stinking, corrupted trash that poisons the place and hurts everyone around them.

Would you want to escape it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"Why am I not surprised you'd ask something like that?"},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"But for me... All that matters is what's here and now."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"Not that I can't tell how much you're skeptical of this boat..."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"Well, what does it matter if it's real or not?
