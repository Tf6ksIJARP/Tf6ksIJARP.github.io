Where's the guy?!"},{"T":"301","3":"This incessant chatter and seemingly brainless barrage of questions... Very Kamui."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"As you can see, he's the same as before."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"To be honest, I was also surprised at the results of the surgery. Tenebrion might have helped him recover, or not... But well, there he is, now."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Then, because he kept nagging the others to get him back to the park, we all decided he should be shoved in the next transport plane and sent over.
