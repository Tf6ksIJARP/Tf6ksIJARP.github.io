He now has over 6,000 total monster damage! With no monsters on the field, Rosetta can't withstand the attack!"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Hmph, don't underestimate me.

Do you need something from the engineering bay?"},{"T":"302","2":"I came to see what the fuss was about.","4":"What are you doing here instead?"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"I see... Looks like we got carried away."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Well, as you can see, I'm playing a card game. Before that, I was here for routine maintenance."},{"T":"301","2":"Duelist Construct","3":"Enough with the chit-chat, Rosetta.
