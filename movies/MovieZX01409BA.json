Are you familiar with this system?"},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"Only just a thing or two."},{"T":"301","2":"Atiel","3":"I'll give you a hand, too!"},{"T":"301","3":"After securing the server room in the research lab, Simon immediately sets about looking for intel on Amberia."},{"T":"301","3":"Not technologically inclined and unable to help, Rosetta is in the room lost in thought."},{"T":"302","2":"What's on your mind?","4":"Tired?"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"I was just thinking about how many Forest Guards were born here."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Maybe..."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"I may be labeled a sinner all the same, but I don't carry the same weight as Diana and the others."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"I was modified because of other reasons. After I was reborn, I've been fighting ever since."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"After all this fighting, I may have gotten stronger. But I still can't change my misfortune..."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"And when I met you and Alpha, I really thought that was the end."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"But I survived, and then I had to face Alpha again. Then this time, I thought it would just be a few minor skirmishes..."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Who'd have thought? We're now up against that Amberia in the legends."},{"T":"302","2":"It's just a coincidence.","4":"Looks like we're all unlucky."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"...Of course, I by no means think I'm special. I'm just used to it is all."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"But enough about me... If we can solve this once and for all, then the Forest Guards can finally rest at ease."},{"T":"302","2":"Why?","4":"But we can't tell anyone about Amberia. Can we?"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"...Bygones can finally be bygones. And we can bring an end to the nightmare known as Amberia."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"It doesn't matter. What matters is that we put the past to rest."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"In fact, many people in the ARU think that the 'tide' is just a ruse by the Forest Guard to ensure our status."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"They're always afraid that we will become the next Amberia."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"They've always been in fear, in fear that another Amberia will rise in the ARU."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Fearing... even with that master code they programmed us with\u2014the code to make us listen to their commands."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"But none of the Forest Guard wishes for revenge... 'Amid torrential snow and wind, the Forest Guard's honor stands strong.'"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"This is an old saying among the Forest Guard... Well, I guess the Forest Guard aren't exactly that old."},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"So... Why did they turn you into Constructs? If they fear the power of humanoid-hybrids, then why would they continue making them?"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"There wasn't a choice. The Punishing Virus poses a terrifying threat."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Corrupted invasions are rare for the ARU, but not nonexistent. We're far from safe..."},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"You could use ordinary machines to deal with the tide. If you can't defeat them, you can always just run. After all, the tide will eventually recede."},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"That, however, is not an option for the Corrupted. So, there's no choice but to use Constructs..."},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"You're walking a fine line... Then how do you stop humanoid-hybrid frames from going 'berserk?'"},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"As long as the frames are made more 'human-like,' it'll be fine\u2014or so I've heard... But I'm afraid only the higher-ups know the technical details."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"The Arctic Route Union... has been, and is still trapped in the nightmare known as 'Amberia'. Everyone has lost hope."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"If we really can get rid of Amberia... The Forest Guards and the ARU as a whole can start looking toward the future."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Commandant, sorry for asking you this right now\u2014but will you help us bring an end to the nightmare that plagues this land?"},{"T":"302","2":"Of course.","4":"That's what I've been doing."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Thank you."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Yes, you're right."},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"Everyone, I found files on Amberia!"},{"T":"301","3":"After searching for some time, Simon jumps in and interrupts your conversation. He points to some records on the screen showing Amberia's true form."},{"T":"301","2":"Atiel","3":"Can... can you still call her a humanoid-hybrid?"},{"T":"301","3":"Your eyes are immediately taken by a figure with a tar-black mass for a lower body on the screen. Your skin crawls at the sight of her almost insectile hands and deconstructional mechanisms."},{"T":"301","3":"A giant woman is connected to the front of the black lower body. You roughly make out that this is a humanoid structure left to synchronize the M.I.N.D."},{"T":"301","3":"Yet, even this humanoid figure does not invoke relief. The bundles of installments and devices jutting out of her only serve to enhance its uncanniness."},{"T":"301","2":"Atiel","3":"This is too much... Even if she never went berserk because of some bug... to see herself become such a monstrosity..."},{"T":"301","3":"\u2014\u2014You would definitely go mad."},{"T":"301","3":"The chamber remains silent, but the same thought lingers in everyone's mind."},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"As long as the frames are made more 'human-like,' huh... But they... they've turned Amberia into a monster."},{"T":"301","3":"Reading through the data, you learn that the Forest Guard's Construct framework is a subsidiary form of the technology used to create Amberia."},{"T":"301","3":"Only intentionally downgraded."},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"...Anyway, the most important information is on the next page."},{"T":"301","3":"Simon could barely maintain composure at the grotesque figure on the screen.

The final entry outlined the specifics on what exactly her code entailed."},{"T":"301","2":"Atiel","3":"The obsolete bionic series\u2014Derek. It's voice is the code..."},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"Ah..."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"The code is... Derek's voice?"},{"T":"301","3":"Everyone finds their mouth agape.
