Now you can go out and see for yourself."},{"T":"301","2":"Qu","3":"The outside world\u2014what a strange word. I don't know how many years have passed since that battle."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Yeah, I remember the battle. It was from that point on that you took on the mantle as the KCC Gravekeeper."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Such valor."},{"T":"301","2":"Qu","3":"I guess I'll take that as a compliment."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Hehe, well then... Welcome to a new world."},{"T":"301","2":"Qu","3":"Quit being polite, hypocrite."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Hypocrite? Perhaps. Who knows?"},{"T":"301","3":"The stagnant river of time begins to flow once more. The first time I left, Kowloong Metropolis and the underground ruins were under construction."},{"T":"301","3":"It was at this moment that I finally saw how humanity lived in today's era."},{"T":"301","2":"GDF Soldier A","3":"Damnit, the defensive line can't hold any longer."},{"T":"301","2":"GDF Soldier B","3":"What about the Support Force? Where are they?"},{"T":"301","2":"GDF Soldier C","3":"Radar indicates that most of the squads have evacuated... We've been abandoned!"},{"T":"301","2":"GDF Soldier A","3":"Damn it!"},{"T":"301","2":"GDF Soldier B","3":"The Corrupted are coming! We're all gonna die!"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Don't give up just yet."},{"T":"301","2":"Soldiers","3":"Who's there?"},{"T":"301","3":"Suddenly, a girl infiltrates the base and interrupts the soldiers."},{"T":"301","3":"She quickly slashes the Corrupted with her glaive, then charges up and throws her weapon at the enemies behind her. The inertia from the impact sends enemies flying back over ten meters before they crash onto the ground."},{"T":"301","3":"She lifts her right hand slightly, and a new glaive forms in her hand."},{"T":"301","2":"GDF Soldier A","3":"It's a Construct!"},{"T":"301","2":"GDF Soldier C","3":"No, that can't be.

The Corrupted in front of you are higher priority right now!"},{"T":"301","3":"Qu leads the charge outside of the base and begins to fight the Corrupted."},{"T":"301","3":"Qu may be skilled, but fighting the vast number of Corrupted while also trying to suppress the Punishing Virus from spreading to the other soldiers pushes her to her limits."},{"T":"301","3":"Now that the battle is over, Qu and the remaining soldier stand in the ruins of the base."},{"T":"301","2":"GDF Soldier A","3":"Th-thank you."},{"T":"301","2":"Qu","3":"I guess I couldn't save everyone."},{"T":"301","2":"GDF Soldier A","3":"You did your best given the number of enemies..."},{"T":"301","2":"Qu","3":"Do you need me to escort you back?"},{"T":"301","2":"GDF Soldier A","3":"That won't be necessary. The main army has abandoned us, so going back will only make it worse. I've heard of a place called 'Oasis' nearby... Want to come along?"},{"T":"301","2":"GDF Soldier A","3":"You show signs of Corrupted, but I'm sure we can avoid a fight if you explain yourself clearly."},{"T":"301","2":"Qu","3":"I'd better not. I think that would only bring harm to both sides."},{"T":"301","2":"GDF Soldier A","3":"If you say so..."},{"T":"301","3":"Hearing this, the soldier salutes Qu. But the soldier has only taken one step after turning to leave before kneeling."},{"T":"301","3":"Qu sees several bloody wounds on his back and even a mechanical Corrupted arm hanging off him."},{"T":"301","2":"Qu","3":"You..."},{"T":"301","3":"Qu rushes over only to discover that he has already stopped breathing."},{"T":"301","3":"Leaving the base, Qu sets up three plaques on the ground for the soldiers and hangs their helmets on top."},{"T":"301","2":"Scavenger","3":"Let us in!"},{"T":"301","2":"City Guard","3":"Not while there are Corrupted out there. If we let you in, our city will be done for."},{"T":"301","3":"Just as several scavengers were outside the city negotiating with the soldiers, Corrupted artillery fire devours them in an instant."},{"T":"301","2":"Lady","3":"I... I beg of you... Let my child in."},{"T":"301","2":"Qu","3":"Alright, I will."},{"T":"301","3":"Upon hearing this, the woman in front of Qu relaxes her clenched fists, but the blind woman cannot see that her child is no longer breathing."},{"T":"301","3":"Separation. Betrayal. Pain. Death."},{"T":"301","3":"These are the themes of this era that shape the world."},{"T":"301","3":"The Punishing Virus has ravaged humanity during their desperate struggle to survive in this post-apocalyptic world."},{"T":"301","3":"Knowledge claimed there was no purgatory; there was no hell.

Hell is right in front of me."},{"T":"301","3":"Humanity's miserable existence is now on the verge of collapse."},{"T":"301","3":"They perish amid struggle, suffering, and torture."},{"T":"301","2":"Qu","3":"Sorry, please forgive my arrogance."},{"T":"301","2":"Qu","3":"But I can't bear to see you continue suffering from reality."},{"T":"301","2":"Qu","3":"Someone must always bear the cross, even if in infamy. That is the Sovereign's duty."},{"T":"301","2":"Qu","3":"It is the duty of the Sovereign to protect that which is precious to them."},{"T":"301","2":"Huaxu","3":"Are you sure you want to do this?"},{"T":"301","2":"Qu","3":"Yes, only by sending those sky dwellers down can we end all of humanity's suffering in an instant."},{"T":"301","2":"Qu","3":"They won't have to continue struggling in this tragic era.
