Stop chasing Xi, you're gonna startle them!"},{"T":"301","2":"Xiuyong","3":"Then tell them to stay put for a second, Nanami!"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"That's up to them! And if you wanna be friends with Xi, you should try to be gentler!"},{"T":"301","2":"Ann","3":"Nanami... Should we pat them the way you do?"},{"T":"301","2":"Xiuyong","3":"Argh... But Xi don't want to come close to us at all..."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Give them time! Whether it's getting interested in humans, or getting close to them..."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"It's gonna be a process! Yep! That's how it is!"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"You're cute, sure, but those critters are just like you! They're new to the world, and everything is unfamiliar!"},{"T":"301","2":"Ann","3":"So... they're also... children?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"You can say that! Newly born, they're just starting to be aware of the world... just like you!"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"You have to get along with each other, just like what you're doing now!"},{"T":"301","2":"Deckard","3":"Nanami, they're trying to run away again!

I've prepared some New Year decorations for you!"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Couplets! They're so well written! Did you write them, Ayla?"},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"Of course not.

Asimov said that being in contact with you guys has introduced it information on Lunar New Year, but I don't really understand what he was saying."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"I see! I can't believe that it's not just cute, it's also super smart!"},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"Right? I also think it's cute, but nobody seems to appreciate it...
