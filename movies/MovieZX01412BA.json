No wonder the numbers don't match up."},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"That doesn't make sense, though. Why would such a large cave go undiscovered for this long...?"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Must be some sort of interference. Look up there\u2014the strange lights. They must be some sort of signal jammer."},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"They'd put so much effort into burying their past mistakes and building this military base, instead of trying to rebuild the ARU..."},{"T":"302","2":"Because they had war in mind.","4":"That's all in the past."},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"Yeah... The captain said that Amberia and the bionics were built for war from the start."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"From the looks of this cave, you can see the true intent of the ARU's leadership. They never swayed from their belief that war was the final solution."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Yeah, Diana. All in the past."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Whatever the past mistakes, let's try our best to make amends."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Oh, how very deep and all, Forest Guards.

My name is Lamia, an Ascendant."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"First Alpha, now Lamia? Do you Ascendants think you can stroll in and out of the ARU, just as you please?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"Well, we just needed something here... That's all."},{"T":"302","2":"Are you the one behind all of this?","4":"Where is Atiel?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"Oh, you are such a funny little tart... Didn't you just arrive at your answer? It's all the ARU's fault."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"Whether it's the bionics that are attacking the ARU,or the Amberia buried in this place\u2014I've got nothing to do with 'em."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"I'm just a little spectator. That's all."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"Oh come on, little pumpkin, you know the answer."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Which means... you have Atiel."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"I'm only here for Amberia. We've got enough juice, so after she's fully charged, we can make her go beep-boop with the code, and... voila!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"Then Amberia will be under my control. After which..."},{"T":"302","2":"You're just telling us that?","4":"Can't you just use the virus to control her?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"...I'm not tryna tell you, you're the brutes who barged in on me talking to myself! Hmph!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"...Asks all the wrong questions\u2014check."},{"T":"301","3":"Lamia cuts the broadcast. Bionics begin pouring out of the dark recesses of the cavern."},{"T":"301","2":"Bionic Machine","3":"Urgh\u2014"},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"Wait, these bionics... They've been corrupted!"},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"Corrupted and Ascendants... Is that Lamia trying to turn the ARU into Kowloong...?"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"We're here to prevent that from happening. Let's break through their forces and continue downward, Commandant."},{"T":"301","3":"As you are about to move, the ice cave begins to rumble."},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"It's a trap?!"}]
