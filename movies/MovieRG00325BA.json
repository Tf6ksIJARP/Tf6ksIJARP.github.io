[{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Are you hurt, Demon King?"},{"T":"301","2":"Demon King","3":"I'm good. Thank you, Holy Maiden."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Can you stop calling me the Holy Maiden? It's so embarrassing. Just call me Liv."},{"T":"301","2":"Demon King","3":"No, you are the Holy Maiden. I'm not going to change that."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"(Sighs)"},{"T":"301","3":"Liv and the probe\u2014who claimed to be the Demon King\u2014embarked on a new journey after running away from the guards."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Sorry for being rude, but are you really the Demon King? I thought he would be a black giant or something."},{"T":"301","2":"Demon King","3":"I was like that until the heroes defeated me. I turned into this form to survive."},{"T":"301","2":"Demon King","3":"Remember when you first saw me? You were calling me Heteromer or something."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Yeah, you looked exactly like that."},{"T":"301","2":"Demon King","3":"If you say so. After all, our world is but a projection of the real world."},{"T":"301","3":"Liv met this Demon King at her spawn point. She was quite terrified in the beginning, but decided to help this world after hearing his words."},{"T":"301","3":"According to him, the King had a bug which made him realize this was nothing but a game world, and he was only an AI created for entertainment."},{"T":"301","3":"That was why he started all the crazy moves."},{"T":"301","2":"Demon King","3":"I don't know exactly what he is thinking, but I guess he is planning to delete the world, then recreate it... And make himself the god of this game."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Delete... What will happen to everyone else in this world?"},{"T":"301","2":"Demon King","3":"They will lose all their data. The storage of this game is limited. Can't make a new world without deleting the data."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"...Are they all going to disappear? They don't even know they are NPCs."},{"T":"301","2":"Demon King","3":"No matter how unrealistic, everybody still believes they are living in the 'real world'..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"But if the King knew he was a game character because of the bug, how did you find out about that?"},{"T":"301","2":"Demon King","3":"Because I had a bug too."},{"T":"301","2":"Demon King","3":"In the original ending, the King was supposed to turn into Kuroro and be defeated by the heroes. But they left the world too early."},{"T":"301","3":"The game didn't end properly, and was suddenly reset until one day, when new heroes\u2014Liv and others\u2014entered again."},{"T":"301","2":"Demon King","3":"A series of errors turned the Demon King into another bug."},{"T":"301","2":"Demon King","3":"Let me make this clear: I don't plan to take control of the world. In the past, the program made me destroy many cities and humans, and that really upset me. Now I am a Demon King of love and peace."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Ahaha..."},{"T":"301","3":"Liv burst into laughter after hearing the somewhat cute machine say love and peace, the latter returned a complaining look."},{"T":"301","2":"Demon King","3":"Ahem. Anyway, the enemies are doing all they can to limit our movement, but there is only one place that we absolutely have to go."},{"T":"301","2":"Demon King","3":"The castle of the last Demon General, Karuna. He was probably the only one left with artifact fragment. Everyone else had theirs taken."},{"T":"301","2":"Demon King","3":"Even one fragment can also increase my power. Then I'll be able to fight."}]
