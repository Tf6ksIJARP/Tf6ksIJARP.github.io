And you're stressed?"},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"Stressed about the diaries."},{"T":"301","3":"She holds up a bundle of neatly strapped notebooks."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"This is the most I can collect in a day, and, presumably, they are still not enough."},{"T":"302","2":"What do you mean?"},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"Instead of these incomplete journals, I require more comprehensive records."},{"T":"301","3":"More comprehensive?"},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"A diary should contain everything its author does in one solar day."},{"T":"301","3":"Your spider-sense is tingling."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"For example... records on activities, records on thoughts, records on visuals, records on audio, records on smell..."},{"T":"302","2":"Wait a sec..."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"Records on touch, records on simulated emotions, records on frame status..."},{"T":"302","2":"Hold on."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"Records on combat, records on weapon maintenance, records on injuries..."},{"T":"301","3":"The girl before you is speaking non-stop at incredible speed.

You don't see health data in that diary, right?"},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"'October 21st.

To eliminate the chance that I record everything onto my paintings..."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"The viability of this experiment is estimated to be high.

It doesn't matter if it was a lie."},{"T":"302","2":"You should still be more careful."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"That's not necessary. From the data I've collected, you pose no threat."},{"T":"301","3":"Looking her in the eyes, you immediately remember the day you met and how quickly she subdued you."},{"T":"301","3":"Maybe it is the light, but you seem to notice a slight change in her tranquil expression."},{"T":"302","2":"...","4":"You're smiling, aren't you?"},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"Smiling... Are you recommending I smile right now?"},{"T":"301","3":"...Never mind. Now is not the time to dwell on it."},{"T":"301","3":"You should return to your mission, now that you have confirmed her safety."},{"T":"301","3":"After all, the airdrops have begun. The conservation area nearby needs you to bring back enough supplies."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"Are you leaving?"},{"T":"302","2":"Yeah. Let's save it for next time if there's something else."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"Next time? The chances of us meeting again have decreased from 1.4% to 0.12%.

The conservation area is one of them, and so is this encounter."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"A correction: we had a 1.4% chance of encountering each other this time.

They may be machines physically, but they still share the same souls as humans."},{"T":"301","3":"Which is why Constructs are not accepted into the Church of Machina."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"Machines do not make mistakes. It has always been like that."},{"T":"301","3":"She does not worry about being heard.
