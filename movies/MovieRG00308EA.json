[{"T":"301","2":"Zanzibaron","3":"Grrrrr\u2014gargh!"},{"T":"301","3":"Zanzibaron made some unpleasant sounds and kept rolling backward, until smashing into the wall."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"This is only possible in games. In reality, the enemy should have broken apart from our power long ago."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"It's probably the angles. I think the armor of that Zan-whatever is crafted very nicely."},{"T":"301","2":"Karenina","3":"Tsk. Next time I'll make sure I hit a home run."},{"T":"301","3":"The heartless judges (and executors) even gave their scores while making comments."},{"T":"301","2":"Zanzibaron","3":"Dammit. How could I, Zanzibaron, the Demon General lose to you..."},{"T":"301","2":"Zanzibaron","3":"But I cannot fall yet. I must protect the artifact..."},{"T":"301","3":"Zanzibaron ignored us and opened the wall behind. Inside the wall was a strange-shaped jade."},{"T":"301","2":"Karenina","3":"Is this one of those plots where the enemy gives us an important item?"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"I guess so. I was expecting the reward after beating him, but he took it out himself. Nice!"},{"T":"301","2":"Zanzibaron","3":"Ouch!"},{"T":"301","3":"Camu hurled his greatsword toward Zanzibaron, who accidentally dropped the jade as he tried to dodge."},{"T":"301","2":"Zanzibaron","3":"No...!"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"It's mine now."},{"T":"301","3":"Camu had already rushed forward and picked up the jade. He pulled the sword out with the other hand, and pointed it at Zanzibaron's head."},{"T":"301","2":"Zanzibaron","3":"Urgh, we Demons...must..."},{"T":"301","3":"Still, Zanzibaron struggled forward, completely ignoring Camu and the blade that could take his life any time. He only had the jade in his eyes."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"What's wrong with this guy?"},{"T":"301","3":"Slightly shocked by this special move that never appeared in the game, Camu backed off a little, but he soon forced Zanzibaron back again with his blade."},{"T":"301","2":"Zanzibaron","3":"You are nothing but the King's minions! I curse you all!"},{"T":"302","2":"So Hassen really is evil, huh?","4":"What do we have to do with the King?"},{"T":"301","2":"Zanzibaron","3":"Isn't that obvious? Give the artifact back to me!"},{"T":"301","2":"Zanzibaron","3":"He must have told you to come here. Give the artifact back to me!"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Shut up!"},{"T":"301","3":"When Zanzibaron was about to charge again, Camu unleashed a slash so fast that separated the space inside the room."},{"T":"301","2":"Zanzibaron","3":"Darn you, heroes! This will not end like this!"},{"T":"301","3":"He then fell off the castle together with the dismembered room, making a loud sound."},{"T":"301","2":"Karenina","3":"Hey, Camu, he looked a bit suspicious..."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Just a game character doing his programmed moves. Now we have defeated the Demon General and got the artifact, let's just go."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"True. We may be able to unlock some new stories after defeating the first Boss."}]
