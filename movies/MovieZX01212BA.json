What on earth happened...?"},{"T":"302","2":"The Ascendants happened.","4":"Is she gonna be okay?"},{"T":"301","2":"Bridget","3":"The Ascendants...? Then you guys must be Gray Raven. It's incredible you made it here alive. Elite squad indeed."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"But we didn't even get anything done. Worse, we..."},{"T":"301","2":"Bridget","3":"Just the fact that you're all alive is something."},{"T":"301","2":"Bridget","3":"Yes, as long as we can keep her M.I.N.D. alive. But she's not returning to the battlefield any time soon."},{"T":"301","2":"Bridget","3":"Anyway, first things first, we gotta bring her back to our base. You guys go ahead and return to battle."},{"T":"301","3":"With that, Bridget motions the driver to start the truck and hops on the back."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Lucia should be fine with the SF people.

Gray Raven, how am I sounding?"},{"T":"302","2":"Mr. President?","4":"Why this device?"},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"...You must be wondering why I'm speaking to you via Ayla's connection device."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Must be the scrambler waves from Kowloong. Not sure if it's effective against the Ascendants, but it sure messed up our comms systems."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Kowloong is broadcasting a scrambling signal. This is the only way I can contact you from outside the city."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"We're already at work fixing the connection, but I'm afraid it's gonna take a while, so I had this comms device sent to you."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"You have new orders for us, I take it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Originally, several, yes.

I'm counting on you."},{"T":"302","2":"Understood.","4":"Can we really defeat the Ascendants?"},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Good. Now take Ayla with you and go."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Not like we can just surrender.
