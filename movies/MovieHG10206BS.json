I didn't know when you would arrive, so I came early, just in case."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"But enough about that. Let's return to our date. The reason I've invited you here is because my recovery has reached an end."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Through exhaustive reviews of prior files, I've ascertained the kind of person I am, and what I must do."},{"T":"302","2":"And what kind of person is that?","4":"What must you do?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"A fairly playful girl, Commandant."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"The thing I'm about to do."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Sit down next to me first. I prepared a sumptuous meal for you."},{"T":"301","3":"Halfway through the sentence, Lucia seems to change into a different person. Her voice lightens, and her smile turns softer than usual."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Strange, isn't it? You won't see this side of me often. Relaxing moments like these are hard to come by, after all."},{"T":"301","3":"At Lucia's insistence, you take the utensils and sit down on a mat draped on the coarse ground."},{"T":"302","2":"You made this, Lucia?","4":"(Eat death)"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...As much as I would like to say 'yes', I left it up to the support staff, in the interest of your health."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"It should be good. I didn't get to taste-test, but I trust the chefs."},{"T":"301","3":"While you eat, you listen to Lucia talk at length about current events."},{"T":"301","3":"Once, you were worried about her turning into a different person after the procedure. But from her words and actions, the new Lucia is simply a little more 'playful.'"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"As the moon rises high, Lucia suddenly goes quiet, her eyes closing as if in prayer."},{"T":"302","2":"What are you doing?","4":"Are you tired?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"I'm summoning the aliens, Commandant. Want to join in?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"No, I'm just trying to summon aliens. With telepathy."},{"T":"302","2":"Aliens?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Mh-hm. I mean, extraterrestrial cultures..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"My records indicate that you once had a conversation with Qu, the leader of Kowloong."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"She once said that Tabula Akasha was all about leaving traces of humanity behind, letting 'travelers' know we were once here... I think by 'travelers', she must have meant aliens."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"I may not be a big fan of this plan, but I do think it's amazing that there might be other cultures, other beings, out there."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Don't you think so too, Commandant? If 'others' really do exist in the universe, what would they look like?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"But no matter what they look like, if they can reach us through the void of space, that would mean that their technology far outstrips ours..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"If that's the case, they may have a way of stopping, maybe even eradicating the Punishing Virus."},{"T":"302","2":"That would be nice.","4":"Maybe even they can't do it."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Yes, indeed it would be."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...Then that would be catastrophic. Aliens infected with the Punishing Virus would be no joke."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"But aliens are probably just wishful thinking, both for Qu and for us..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"If you want something, you have to reach for it. Fight for it. For me, for you, for all of us."},{"T":"301","3":"You suddenly feel Lucia's embrace from behind."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Though I may never be myself again, I think this is how 'Lucia' expresses her emotions."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"So, just like this... let me be with you, Commandant."}]
