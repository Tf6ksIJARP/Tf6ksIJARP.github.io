The screams taunt him, haunt him... until even the noises turn quiet, and all that remains is the last word of a pointless fight."},{"T":"301","3":"Changyu's pupils dilate as he falls to the ground by his friend, the last thing in his sight being a group of medical personnel with tranquilizers in their hands slowly approaching."},{"T":"301","3":"The smell of gasoline is what wakes Changyu."},{"T":"301","3":"He lets out a quiet moan, struggling to shake off the effect of the tranquilizer. He tries to blink, only to find cold, apathetic fluorescent light bathing over him."},{"T":"301","3":"This is not the Nighter. Every inch of this space screams indifference. The deep, roaring waves of the ocean are replaced by the heavy, persistent clanking of an engine."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"You're awake."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"This is..."},{"T":"301","3":"The person standing by Changyu wears a clean, tailored suit, donning the carved face of a Westerner."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"...Akdilek?"},{"T":"301","2":"Akdilek Personnel","3":"Perceptive. You're on the commoner carriage of Asslam, Changyu. You've been traded to us as merchandise."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"What..."},{"T":"301","3":"Changyu stands up and looks at the strange interior of a train. He has never been on a train before. It does not feel different from the Nighter."},{"T":"301","3":"He takes a step forward to the massive floor-to-ceiling window in front of him. He finds his expression reflected on the filthy glass window, and he finds the sight beyond the window reflected in his eyes."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"The collar..."},{"T":"301","3":"Changyu's fingers gently brush over his neck, but they find nothing where the collar once was."},{"T":"301","3":"It is such a foreign yet familiar feeling."},{"T":"301","3":"The train is plowing ahead at full speed.

We are not some dark cults that terrorize and bully people."},{"T":"301","2":"Akdilek Personnel","3":"But they were useful rumors. Taking advantage of your public perception is a fundamental lesson all businessmen must learn. Our predicament, for example, has led us to you."},{"T":"301","2":"Akdilek Personnel","3":"You have potential. As a fighter... and a companion, one that we can count on."},{"T":"301","2":"Akdilek Personnel","3":"We will not force you to stay here, so this is your one chance to choose.
