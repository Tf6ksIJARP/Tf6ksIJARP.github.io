Cables are snapping from the chaos as densely packed giant computers fall one after another, shutting down after their brief hums stop."},{"T":"301","3":"Those grey, broken machines were once part of 'it.'"},{"T":"301","3":"A familiar figure is still working before the terminal amidst the sparks and destructions. Alarming redness drips from her back to the floor while her blonde hair is cut cleanly at her neck as if there was a precise strike."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"Injured staff confirmed... R-requesting medical support..."},{"T":"301","3":"It hears its voice speaking after it finishes scanning its surrounding. The voice belongs to the personality the administrative AI has used the most."},{"T":"301","3":"All the comms channels are offline. Its request is unanswered."},{"T":"301","2":"Female Researcher","3":"...Made it..."},{"T":"301","2":"Female Researcher","3":"Good... You aren't infected either..."},{"T":"301","3":"After pressing the last button, the human struggles to stand up and walks toward it."},{"T":"301","3":"Her bloodstained face is plain to see. She reaches out toward it."},{"T":"301","3":"It can feel the human's soft yet wet touches on its face. They come from her blood-soaked fingers."},{"T":"301","2":"Female Researcher","3":"The kid... she named you 'Haicma', didn't she?"},{"T":"301","2":"Female Researcher","3":"Your neural logic circuit has already\u2014cough\u2014replaced your identification with that name."},{"T":"301","2":"Female Researcher","3":"You approved of it yourself."},{"T":"301","3":"Based on her wounds and the amount of blood she has lost, the researcher should be in immense pain, but she is smiling in relief."},{"T":"301","3":"Haicma can see itself from the reflection in her eyes. No longer a giant computer with a camera flashing red light, it appears to be a human woman now."},{"T":"301","3":"It realizes that its local operating system has been transferred from the computer blocks to this bionic frame."},{"T":"301","3":"The white-haired humanoid slowly raises its\u2014her hands and observes her body, comprehending the new and strange experience. Her mind rapidly runs in the new memory shell, capturing every new sensation with her fingertips."},{"T":"301","3":"The identification code reveals this body to be a prototype, created to be a new line of mechanoid nannies with the appearance of a young woman to look more friendly to young children."},{"T":"301","2":"Female Researcher","3":"The virus has spread to the lab... All registered machines are in the process of being destroyed... Time's running out.

The heavy door is dented alarmingly from the other side as deafening roars announce the countdown to her demise."},{"T":"301","3":"Haicma's mind is flooded by the data stream.

Please, tell me..."},{"T":"301","3":"The researcher's vital sign is barely noticeable at this point. Her lips tremble as she holds up her hand, grasping Haicma's fingertip with the last ounce of her strength."},{"T":"301","3":"In the end, she leaves Haicma with a serene smile. Haicma cannot understand how she can be so calm before an excruciatingly painful death."},{"T":"301","2":"Haicma","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"Haicma repeats her question over and over, but as the fleeting lights completely fade away, she does not receive an answer from the researcher."},{"T":"301","3":"She has no idea when the explosions and the shaking stopped, and the room is eerily silent.

The heavy locked door opens easily from the mechanoid's strength, and the scent of blood and smoke rushes in. A man falls across the doorstep as it opens."},{"T":"301","3":"Haicma recognizes him as the man who often showed up with the female researcher. Beyond this lab, he was also Nanami's father."},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami would always talk about her perfect family and her loving parents with an innocent smile."},{"T":"301","3":"His terminal on the floor shows that the last flight to evacuate here has left.
