[{"T":"301","3":"Some time earlier\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"In an arctic land, a fisher, burdened by a bulging bag of tools, is trudging forward in the snow."},{"T":"301","3":"Ahead of him is the port shared by members of the Arctic Route Union, with a couple ships lazing nearby. A group of sailors are huddled around a furnace-like heating device, chatting away."},{"T":"301","3":"The fisher strides up to them and shouts in his signature booming voice."},{"T":"301","2":"Fisher","3":"Oi, we sailin' today?"},{"T":"301","3":"His deafening voice dusts snow off the trees and draws the sailors' attention."},{"T":"301","3":"The words evidently reach them, but the fisher is met with a 'No' gesture by an annoyed-looking sailor."},{"T":"301","2":"Fisher","3":"Aye aye, c'mon, let's sail today!"},{"T":"301","3":"The fisher is aware of the gesture, but he continues on and joins in with the sailors."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"Naw, won't do."},{"T":"301","2":"Fisher","3":"Yer keep sayin' that over and over. How long ya havin' your vacation?"},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"We ain't slackin', mate. Why else d'ya thunk we're here?"},{"T":"301","2":"Fisher","3":"'S roight! Why EVEN are y'all here if ya ain't getting packed for sea?"},{"T":"301","3":"The fisher flares up at the sailors. The winds are stable, stable to the point that staying on land is blasphemy. The sea, the fishes call."},{"T":"301","2":"Fisher","3":"We have them Babyloony-bolognese now, just jab one of 'em serums if it gets all viral-like. C'mon, let's board!"},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"Ugh... Fer the last time, NO SAILING TODAY!"},{"T":"301","3":"The fisher was shaking and rattling the sailor. Unable to take it anymore, the sailor stands and tries to reason with the fisher."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"I dunno why yer fishers ain't sharin' pipes with one 'nother, but we've been repeatin' it\u2014the Corrupted in the sea..."},{"T":"301","2":"Fisher","3":"Thar's always Corrupted there! And we have them big fat cannons on the ship!"},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"Just listen!"},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"...The Corrupted in the sea's been hivin' it up gettin' all feisty-like. And since whatever, them stray red-eyes been bandin' all together in one place."},{"T":"301","2":"Fisher","3":"Stray reddies...? Even those from the no-man's zones?"},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"Yarr, for sum reason they all dived somewhere. Dunno where they be headed, but they're relayin' it through the sea 'ere."},{"T":"301","3":"Hearing the sailor, the fisher begins to realize the gravity of the situation. He pulls at the tools tilting from his back and slings them astern."},{"T":"301","2":"Fisher","3":"Uh... We gon' be safe here?"},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"Least for now they're not tryna' land. Simply shoalin' it up here 'fore going somewhere else."},{"T":"301","2":"Fisher","3":"So them Corrupted's getting fewer around here, aye? When they're done swarmin' it all up in the seas, then we should be safe to go?"},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"I guess..."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"It won't be possible."},{"T":"301","3":"Interrupting the conversation is a spear-wielding centauress, followed by a group of her kind. Just like the fisher, they are bearing bags."},{"T":"301","2":"Fisher","3":"Oh, Forest Guards... There ain't any of them Corruptoes here, eh?"},{"T":"301","3":"Astonished by the presence of the humanoid hybrid Constructs, the fisher asks inquisitively, curious as to why they are here."},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"The Corrupted are all in the sea. We're here for something else."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"You mean..."},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"We don't know when the Corrupted will be back. But this much we know\u2014nothing good will come out of it if they gather up."},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"So can we borrow your ships, sailors?"},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"You tailin' em red-eyes?"},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"Yes, to find out what they're up to. I... have a bad feeling about this."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"...Whadda we do, Capt?"},{"T":"301","3":"The sailor turns to ask the man who has stayed silent all this time. The man ponders, his eyes darting between his ships and the Forest Guards."},{"T":"301","2":"Captain","3":"I can lend you the ships, but on one condition."},{"T":"301","3":"Diana furrows her eyebrows at the captain's response. She falters a little, but she quickly hides her expression."},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"We don't have much to offer in exchange. If it can go cheaper..."},{"T":"301","2":"Captain","3":"Not for this, no."},{"T":"301","3":"The captain loudly interrupts Diana in a sullen voice. An embarrassed look crosses Diana's face."},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"...Because we're sinners?"},{"T":"301","2":"Captain","3":"Pah, you think I still care about that? You can have the ship, sink it, whatever. But all of you must come back 'ere in one piece\u2014that's my condition."},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"Diana's consternation quickly gives way to joy. She holds the captain's big stretched-out hand."},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"Thank you. We promise to hold up our end of the bargain."},{"T":"301","2":"Captain","3":"Alright then. Boys! Give them the keys. And get your stinky laundry off the ships!"},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"Wait, Captain, are we not going with them?"},{"T":"301","2":"Captain","3":"We can't fight. We'll only hold them back if we go, that I'm sure of. Alright then, move it!"},{"T":"301","3":"Following the captain's command, the sailors swing to action. Even the fisher, still in a daze, joins the effort. The Forest Guards murmur between themselves."},{"T":"301","2":"Forest Guard","3":"Didn't know their attitude toward us had changed so much..."},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"Which is all the more reason for us to find out what the Corrupted are up to."},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"Not only to protect ourselves, but also to protect this place."},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"We'll board the ships as soon as they're ready. Forest Guards, prepare to set sail!"},{"T":"301","2":"Forest Guard","3":"Understood!"},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"...Rosetta, I know you'd do the same thing."}]
