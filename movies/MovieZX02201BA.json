[{"T":"301","3":"The silence of the conference hall is broken by Hassen's footsteps."},{"T":"301","3":"He makes his way to the other end of the long cold desk and sits down, taking in the sight of this building with a history as old as Babylonia."},{"T":"301","3":"The huge conference hall is only filled by a few people, others are participating as holograms projected on their seats. The symbols of the Judicial Court, Executive Court, Control Court, and the military army makes this spacious hall appear to be even more solemn."},{"T":"301","3":"The pillars supporting the dome of the hall are all a record of history in the form of numerous name engravings. They were the ones who helped make the World Government possible."},{"T":"301","3":"History can be tasted in the solemn air."},{"T":"301","3":"The mark of the World Government which bears the hope of humanity appears at the top of the room with dignity. Another 'World Government Conference' is about to start."},{"T":"301","3":"The topics for discussion appear as blue data flow in front of the seats."},{"T":"301","3":"From Operation Acadia long ago to the recent battle commands against the Ascendants, they are all included in the discussion topics."},{"T":"301","3":"The councilmen all understand that the topics that appear in the 'World Government Summit' all bear grave importance to Babylonia or humanity."},{"T":"301","3":"Each topic had been a crucial point in the history of humanity, a pivotal decision that shapes the future of Babylonia\u2014all that sways the boat that is the history of humanity."},{"T":"301","3":"In comparison to that, topics brought up in the 'World Government Conference' affect the world in a far lesser scale, which is why most participate in the form of a hologram."},{"T":"301","3":"The lights on the dome flicker off one by one, enshrouding the space in darkness."},{"T":"301","3":"It is as if a veil of ink has been deposited on the conference hall, blurring the lines of things."},{"T":"301","3":"This dim space allows one to imagine themselves on an isolated island among the vast universe of darkness. Right after that, bits of light begin to illuminate the place like stars."},{"T":"301","3":"The stars\u2014data projections that appear on the screen between the pillars\u2014color the 'universe.'"},{"T":"301","3":"These stars are the 'voices of the people.'"},{"T":"301","3":"Citizens of the World Government upload their thoughts through their personal terminals, which then converge into a huge data flow on Gestalt."},{"T":"301","3":"Gestalt runs at full efficiency to extract important data from this flow and summarize them into a simple display to project in the conference hall, allowing the councilmen to 'hear' the voices of the people."},{"T":"301","3":"Hassen stands, wrapped in the light and announces the start of the conference."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"First on the agenda\u2014recently, Akdilek proposed amendments to a treaty signed in the past, demanding us to provide more Helium-3. I would like to know your thoughts on this matter."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman A","3":"92% of the people think that for the stability of humanity, we should agree to our ally's demand if we have enough resources to spare."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman B","3":"However, 7% think that the treaties are sacred, agreeing to the amendments would diminish Babylonia's authority, and that if it happens once there will be a second time. They would just demand resources from us indefinitely and we'd lose the upper hand."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman A","3":"But don't forget it's thanks to Akdilek that we were able to resume our ground logistics and trades with the conservation area."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman B","3":"Those blood-sucking merchants are requesting to change the treaty now precisely because they know that. We'll just be walking into their trap."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"To summarize, the Control Court is not in favor of agreeing to Akdilek's request."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Akdilek is an ally that can be negotiated with, as long as the content is realistic, there will be another chance for discussion."},{"T":"301","3":"A calm voice emits from behind the Control Court's symbol, interrupting the two councilmen's squabble."},{"T":"301","3":"The speaker is a gray-haired woman, one of the few who were actually present in the conference hall. Time has mercilessly decorated her short hair with streaks of white and etched wrinkles on her face, but her sharp eyes remain determined."},{"T":"301","3":"Those pair of eyes have witnessed countless storms in the history of humanity, and it is exactly all that she has endured that allowed her to stay vigilant."},{"T":"301","3":"It may be exhausting to have to stay on edge at all times, but she still does it because she understands the duty of the Control Court\u2014she understands the responsibility one has to bear as the person in charge of said court."},{"T":"301","3":"She is the one who reins in those who stray and ensures that the conference does not endanger humanity."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Hmm... To sustain a friendly relationship while still being able to maintain authority. Voting regarding Congresswoman Hilda's proposal begins now."},{"T":"301","3":"Hassen presses the green button in front of him. The screen between the pillars shows a huge gauge panel. After a few seconds, Gestalt displays the result."},{"T":"301","2":"Gestalt","3":"97.1% are in favor of Ombudswoman Hilda's proposal, 0.8% opposing votes, and 2.1% abstained. The supporting rate is higher than the minimum requirements. This proposal is passed."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Good. The Judicial Court will draft the new amendments and pass it on to the Control Court for filing. I'll sign it after the Diplomatic Court clears it."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Moving on to the second topic of the day\u2014Nikola's proposal to expand the army..."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"That is the last of the topics for discussion today, any questions?"},{"T":"301","3":"The conference did not go on for long. This 'well-oiled machine' operates at maximum capacity to lead humanity, going through discussions efficiently and solving problems in the way most appealing to the public."},{"T":"301","3":"A hologram of a congressman lights up at Hassen's question."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman C","3":"Mr. President, this isn't a question regarding any of the topics discussed but a personal question."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman C","3":"About the return ceremony of \u3010kuroname\u3011 from Atlantis, was it necessary for it to be so lavish?"},{"T":"301","3":"A projection of a crowd appears in the middle of the conference hall."},{"T":"301","3":"It shows a crowd cheering with joyous expressions. One can feel the atmosphere of the event just by watching."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman C","3":"This one ceremony exhausted resources that could have sustained a small living area in Babylonia for three days. I don't see how it is logical to use up all those resources just to celebrate a soldier completing their mission and reuniting with their team."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"They fought off the Ascendant Lamia and brought the hope of Atlantis back to Babylonia. It can be said that it was a historic moment in the advancement of science."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"A lot of citizens volunteered to participate in the ceremony, which naturally leads to more resources being exhausted."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Adding in all that \u3010kuroname\u3011 has achieved on land, of course people would want to celebrate the return of a hero."},{"T":"301","3":"Hassen motions toward the holographic crowd."},{"T":"301","3":"The crowd dims, finally leaving only the Gray Raven visible."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman C","3":"But it's been a while since we've paraded a whole team of Constructs in front of the public for them to worship."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman C","3":"Wouldn't a whole team be harder to control compared to 'The Undying Loy'?"},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Yes, we know."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"But people are mentally strained from the constant war, they need something to rely on spiritually. They need hope."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Hope is not something we can just make. It's something that exists because people wish for it."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"We are merely listening to the wants of the people."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman C","3":"Even if it's something as trivial as hope?"},{"T":"301","2":"Hilda","3":"Hope has never been something 'trivial.'"},{"T":"301","2":"Hilda","3":"Have you never read mythology, Congressman Fermi?"},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman C","3":"...What does mythology have to do with this?"},{"T":"301","2":"Hilda","3":"Aren't you curious as to why heroes were written in similar ways no matter the origin of the myths?"},{"T":"301","2":"Hilda","3":"Someone always loses their peaceful life, and has to go through numerous trials before returning triumphantly, basked in glory and praise."},{"T":"301","2":"Hilda","3":"Under the guise of a hero is just a normal human, but people regard them as a champion equal to the gods nonetheless."},{"T":"301","2":"Hilda","3":"It is because heroes inspire hope in people. And when there is enough hope, you can lead the people. But if you destroy hope, you become the enemy of the people."},{"T":"301","2":"Hilda","3":"Which is why hope is never 'trivial.' IT can be one of the most powerful weapons if used correctly."},{"T":"301","2":"Hilda","3":"I will leave the rest of the explanation to Commander Nikola."},{"T":"301","3":"As if on cue, Nikola looks up from the reports in his hand."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"I'm sure everyone has noticed the frequent interferences Kurono has been causing recently."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"It was necessary to expose \u3010kuroname\u3011 to the public in order to end these unsavory exchanges with them."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"It is to protect Gray Raven as much as to serve as a warning to Kurono."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"The public's attention is the best surveillance. Even Kurono cannot do as they please under constant public attention."},{"T":"301","2":"Hilda","3":"At least for now."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Which is why we have prepared a special mission for the newly reunited Gray Raven, in hopes of prolonging the temporary protection."},{"T":"301","3":"As the councilman reacts by staying silent, Hassen plasters on his usual smile."},{"T":"301","3":"He claps to indicate the end of the conference. The holograms flicker out while the remaining councilmen filter out of the hall."},{"T":"301","3":"Soon, only Hassen, Nikola, and Hilda are left."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Kurono has eyes everywhere. There was no need to announce our objectives out loud for the whole world to see."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"It's fine. I'm certain Kurono already knows all this so it wouldn't have made a difference."},{"T":"301","2":"Hilda","3":"And there's nothing they can do about it at the moment."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Hah..."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"It's been a while since the three of us had a chat."},{"T":"301","2":"Hilda","3":"Private interactions can lead to unfair judgment. As the leader of the Control Court, I have to refrain from private meetings with you to remain fair."},{"T":"301","2":"Hilda","3":"But there are exceptions, such as when discussing something as unique as what we are going to now."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Shall we get on with it then?"},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"So what have the Control Court and the Science Council found out about the Omega File?"},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Depending on the significance, we may have to prepare for a large-scale World Government Conference."},{"T":"301","2":"Hilda","3":"The conclusion is already on your terminals. I just sent it through the encrypted channel a second ago."}]
