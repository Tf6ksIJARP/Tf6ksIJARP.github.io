The rain has yet to arrive, but the sound of thunder has."},{"T":"301","3":"A thunderstorm will soon envelop the city. The sound of waves is getting nearer."},{"T":"301","3":"The city has submerged considerably."},{"T":"301","3":"Looking out on a street in the main city, you no longer see the landing pad. Only the top of a few satellite cities remains above water."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"The city is still sinking. I have no idea if their safeguard for the submergence threshold is still working or not. If it doesn't stop going down, the water pressure will destroy it all."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"We've got two options: either we find a way to stop the city from submerging, or we head for the reactor directly, hoping we'll find some key intel before it all goes poof."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Whichever we choose, we won't be able to find out... where they are. We don't have time to search all of these buildings one by one."},{"T":"302","2":"These Corrupted are kind of strange."},{"T":"301","3":"Vera nods."},{"T":"301","3":"There are clearly two kinds of Corrupted here."},{"T":"301","3":"One of them is the Cleaner Bots that were serving this base. The emblems on these mechanoids are obvious."},{"T":"301","3":"The other one... You cannot tell where they come from."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"They're probably Corrupted that infested the nearby ocean recently. They were the ones who brought the Punishing Virus here."},{"T":"302","2":"Their level of infection is different.","4":"Their level of abrasion is different."},{"T":"301","3":"Vera takes a look at the Corrupted remains scattered on the ground."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"The machines from the base are only faintly infected. The abrasion from seawater is barely noticeable."},{"T":"301","3":"They have not been infected for long, thus their desire to attack humans is more restrained."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Hah, what an unfortunate end to a paradise. Having been isolated from the Punishing Virus-infected world for so many years, it is still going to fall."},{"T":"302","2":"It's a shame."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Did you think I was feeling sorry for it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Don't be mistaken.
