The broken mechanoids that are running around will do as the ghasts of Yama."},{"T":"301","2":"Bunshiro","3":"I just need someone to command the play to begin. It can be done in the control booth in the back. And then... I can act."},{"T":"301","2":"Karenina","3":"Why don't you just cue yourself in?"},{"T":"301","2":"Bunshiro","3":"For us specialized mechanoids, the control booth is sacrosanct.
