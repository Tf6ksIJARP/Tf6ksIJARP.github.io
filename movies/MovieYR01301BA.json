[{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"...It's a complete failure. Looks like we've still overestimated our power."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"The Ascendants are formidable foes after all. Though that 'Huaxu' thing's taken, we still kept the city intact in the end... Sort of."},{"T":"301","3":"After the battle in Kowloong, Akdilek and the Forsaken returned to their campsites to rest. The leaders are now sitting and discussing the next issue."},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"But they likely won't be thanking us for this. Most of Kowloong is in ruins. Even if they manage to salvage the place, rebuilding will likely be hell for them."},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"Speaking of, you know what the link chamber is?"},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"I've heard of it before from some member who left Babylonia. It's a machine that allows a commandant to link remotely, or something... So what about it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"Babylonia seems to have successfully downsized these chambers."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"Downsizing... Are they planning something big?"},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"Probably. I only know that Babylonia is using their results for the foundation of their next step."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"So that's why they're leaving squads in Kowloong to help them rebuild..."},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"That's all the info I got. What about your end, Forsaken boss?"},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"Don't get it wrong. I never agreed to exchange information with you."},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"Looks like you're trying to do a dine and dash on my train."},{"T":"301","3":"Watanabe's face takes on a stunned expression as Jamilah's words leave her mouth. After a short pause, he sighs resignedly."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"...Fine. Just know that this info isn't something you can use as 'goods.'"},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"Whether it can or can't is something I'll decide."},{"T":"301","3":"Watanabe hands a terminal to Jamilah. The screen shows a coordinate and a huge red X."},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"What's this?"},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"This is information I got from... an Ascendant. It's supposedly their next target."},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"That red X is pointing to another Ascendant... Are Ascendants targeting other Ascendants?"},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"Well, apparently, the leader of Kowloong is also an Ascendant. Maybe the Ascendants aren't all on the same side."},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"Indeed, this is also a possibility."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"If there is infighting among the Ascendants, we will have an easier time, right?"},{"T":"301","3":"The one who spoke is Changyu, who has just finished vehicle maintenance. Sophia follows, holding her tools."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"Speaking of which... Leader, should we consider going to a water park for our next stop?"},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"A water park?"},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"Yep. The location those coordinates point to is called... What was it..."},{"T":"301","2":"Sophia","3":"Venus Splash Park. In records of the Golden Age, it seems it was a 'movie-themed private water park.'"},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"Yep, yep, that one. Sophia and I happened to see it while assessing the database, and we even discussed going there."},{"T":"301","2":"Sophia","3":"...You're the one who wants to go, Changyu."},{"T":"301","2":"Changyu","3":"You didn't say you don't want to, Sophia!"},{"T":"301","2":"Sophia","3":"But Sophia has warned Changyu that the Venus Splash Park is surrounded by the ocean and there is no known track leading there."},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"...What a strange choice. Have you heard anything else?"},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"That's all. The Ascendants didn't hide their tracks intentionally, and if Babylonia is not blind, they will know soon after we know."},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"Is that why you said this can no longer be called 'goods'?"},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"Yes... If we calculate from the time we boarded the vehicle, it should be arriving at the station about now."},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"Right. Just get off at the broken stop ahead?"},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"If it's you guys, I think it won't hurt to stay on the train. We will have an empty carriage after the re-org. So how about it? Want to become an Akdilek member?"},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"...Stop joking. The Forsaken are an independent group and we have no interest in serving anyone else."},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"I know you have a history with Babylonia, but that shouldn't stop us from working together."},{"T":"301","2":"Watanabe","3":"No need to worry about that. The Forsaken... are not a group formed from grudges and obsessions."}]
