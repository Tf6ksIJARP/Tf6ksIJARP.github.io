That's all we got on our first day of battle?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vanessa","3":"Teams that are lagging behind will need to crank it up a notch."},{"T":"301","3":"At night, the city finally ushered in a brief calm. However, occasional gunfire can still be heard in the distant streets. With the Gray Ravens' efforts, the team finds a safe building in Zone B to be used as a temporary resting point."},{"T":"301","3":"After reporting the progress of the first day of operation, you enter the rest point from the corridor to find Lee already waiting on the other side of the door."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Finished reporting in?"},{"T":"302","2":"Yes."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Come take a look at this."},{"T":"301","3":"Lee gently swipes his hand, causing a file to appear midair."},{"T":"302","2":"What's this?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"I deciphered it from the terminal in the city today."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"The document explains why outsiders can't find any information on the city."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Because this was an evacuation point for one of the Acadia Operations."},{"T":"302","2":"Which one?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"I can't recover any specific data, so I can't say for sure which one."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Based on the results, the evacuation operation failed and Corrupted occupied the entire city."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Resources, materials and manpower reserves, all of which were buried when this city was besieged. In the present era, it looks like others have even gone through and erased records."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Only until recently have we been able to return to this city, but everything was left in disarray."},{"T":"301","3":"The records fragments are exactly as Lee describes. Vague words recorded at the beginning of the retreat; the sudden attack from the Corrupted; and the last words of humans that chose to stay within the city."},{"T":"301","3":"After reading the file, Lee gently taps a corner of the file, and it disappears without a trace."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Alright, I'm going to destroy it if you're finished reading it."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"After all, the powers that be don't want anyone else finding any clues about the city."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Lucia take watch up top. I'll continue to patrol the streets down below. Rest up, Commandant. Another tough battle awaits us tomorrow."},{"T":"301","3":"As he finishes speaking, Lee walks past you and follows the corridor downstairs."},{"T":"302","2":"(Prepare to rest)"},{"T":"301","3":"After deciding what to do next, you walk toward a shabby sofa in the rest point. It is the only piece of furniture on the whole floor. Lucia has moved it from who-knows-where."},{"T":"301","3":"The walls are pockmarked with bullet holes. The French windows on the south side were damaged during the evacuation, leaving only shards of glass in the grooves above and below the windows. Unobstructed beams of moonlight shine through the windows, bringing dim light into the dark interior."},{"T":"301","3":"Sitting on the sofa, your tight nerves from such an intense day can finally enjoy a moment of respite."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Commandant?"},{"T":"301","3":"Liv's voice can be heard from behind the sofa. Turning your head, you see Liv walk over toward you."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Are you taking a break?"},{"T":"302","2":"I just sat down."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Ah... Are your hands feeling any better?"},{"T":"302","2":"I can't feel anything.","4":"A bit better."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Huh?! Let me check your wounds!"},{"T":"302","2":"I was just joking."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Not funny..."},{"T":"302","2":"How do you feel?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Good to know."},{"T":"302","2":"How do you feel?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"I feel a lot better. I've fully regained control of my Levi-Gun."},{"T":"302","2":"I wasn't talking about your frame."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Huh?"},{"T":"302","2":"I was talking about being in the Gray Ravens."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Um..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"I think there's a huge difference between the Gray Ravens and Egret."},{"T":"302","2":"I've heard stories of Vanessa's tactics."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"I'm not talking about tactics. I mean... dynamic."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"I'm sure everyone else has only ever heard of Egret's successes. Vanessa single-handedly kept all issues with the team's dynamic from ever seeing the light of day."},{"T":"302","2":"So, is that why Vanesa was so confrontational with you?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Yeah... I think she believes that my joining Gray Raven is an act of defiance to her authority."},{"T":"302","2":"..."},{"T":"302","2":"I'm sorry for everything you've been through."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Hmm? No, it's nothing. Don't be sorry."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"You're a lot different than Vanessa."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"With our time together, I've gradually come to realize why Lucia was so persistent in the training room."},{"T":"302","2":"Persistent?","4":"Training room?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Hmm? You don't know, Commandant?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Err... I've said too much."},{"T":"302","2":"?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Uh, never mind. It's no big deal. Maybe Lucia will tell you when the time is right."},{"T":"302","2":"Got it."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"That's what makes you so special, \u3010kuroname\u3011."},{"T":"302","2":"How so?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Well... I think it's the respect and trust you give Constructs."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"You never push anyone to talk about or do something they don't want to."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Every Construct at your side has freedom and the right to choose. We can all do as we please. We're not just weapons and tools..."},{"T":"302","2":"Am I really that different...?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Of course!"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"But your unpredictability still makes us worried."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"I hope you'll pay more attention to yourself next time. Don't be so careless."},{"T":"302","2":"I'll do better next time.","4":"I will."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"As for Lee, even though he isn't great at expressing himself, he worries about others to the point of being overbearing."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"As for Lucia, her judgement may be clouded on occasion, but she still presses onward."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Overall, I think every member of the Gray Ravens is truly wonderful."},{"T":"301","3":"As if a little abashed for what she had just said, Liv stands before you with her head held low trying to hide her expression from you."},{"T":"302","2":"I hope you keep watching out for us.","4":"Thanks."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Commandant..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"How am I overbearing and unable to express myself..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Lee, why don't you go in?"},{"T":"301","3":"Standing in the corridor and leaning against the door to the rest point, Lee suddenly sees Lucia walk down the corridor."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"It's nothing."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Really?"},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia tilts her head slightly in confusion and continues to approach the rest point. Reaching the door, she puts her hand on the door handle."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Lucia."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"What is it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"I found some things while patrolling the streets. I need to you come retrieve it with me."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Understood."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Thanks. It won't take long."},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia nods and turns to leave. Seeing her go downstairs, Lee sighs and follows her."},{"T":"301","3":"Unbeknownst to others, Lee looks back at the door to the rest point before leaving. No one notices that Lee's eyebrows, which have been firmly knit since the start of the mission, have finally relaxed for a moment."}]
