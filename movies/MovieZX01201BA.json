Their instrumental chirps lighten the atmosphere."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Yo, is that a shark over there? Capt., lend me your scythe for a sec!"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"How many times have I told you, Kamui... Be patient and prudent while on standby."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"But hey, even the Gray Ravens are roosting over there."},{"T":"301","3":"Kamui points to where Liv and Lucia are standing. Lucia, as always, is carefully studying the surroundings. Liv, on the other hand, seems a bit excited by the sight of the sea."},{"T":"301","3":"On an unrelated note, Pulao gifted Lucia the stage costume from before."},{"T":"301","3":"Liv is leaning against the ledge. One hand on the taffrail, the other stretching out to the sea as if fishing for something."},{"T":"301","3":"At Lucia's hint, Liv notices the gaze from everyone. A blush slowly creeps over her petrified face."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Uh, I... I."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"See, even the Gray Ravens are chillin' and having a good time. Capt., we should take a break too!"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Until the ship reaches the shore, we cannot let our guard down. Commandant, could you please keep your people on their toes?"},{"T":"302","2":"Let's get some rest while we can.","4":"Yeah, I guess we should get ready."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Hurrah!"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"...Very well. I respect your decision."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Thank you."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Et tu, Commandant?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Yazi","3":"I am terribly sorry. We're still fixing up the previous 'system malfunction,' so we cannot dock just yet. We hope you're doing okay on the ship."},{"T":"301","3":"The figure walking over is Yazi, a member of Kowloong Crew. Once an enemy, but after the death of Villier, she confessed her wrongdoings, even offering to make up for it."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Well, at least this time we're not surrounded by enemies, so that's a plus. I suppose you're done getting things back in order on the ship?"},{"T":"301","2":"Yazi","3":"Only halfway or so. Pulao and the others are still busy patching things up. I came here to check if you needed anything."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Well, in that case, let's talk about something that's on top of everyone's mind. You're absolutely sure we're headed for that 'city,' right?"},{"T":"301","2":"Yazi","3":"Yes, the ship will return to its true course as soon as the system comes back online. You will see the real Kowloong soon."},{"T":"302","2":"Are there still people living there?","4":"What kind of place is it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Yazi","3":"We may have been gone for a while, but according to the details in the other plan, Kowloong is built to last."},{"T":"301","2":"Yazi","3":"An urban fortress where cultural relics and important technologies are preserved."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Have you made contact with Kowloong since you restored the system? Say, reporting to them about your return...?"},{"T":"301","2":"Yazi","3":"About that..."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Ay, don't pause on that! The place can't be usurped like this ship or sumthin', can it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Yazi","3":"That would be an unlikely scenario. It is only that our messages are all met with silence."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"I don't mean to offend, but I'd assume you wouldn't make an elementary mistake like... messing up the channel frequency."},{"T":"301","2":"Yazi","3":"Naturally. We matched up everyone's database to reconfirm. The frequency is correct."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"If that is indeed the case, then something must be going on at our destination."},{"T":"301","2":"Crew Member","3":"Lady Yazi, we found a usable port!"},{"T":"301","3":"A sudden message from the loudspeaker interrupts the conversation and draws everyone's attention to the port the ship is approaching."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Looks like a thorough investigation is in order. Might I ask for your squad's assistance, Gray Raven's commandant?"},{"T":"302","2":"Sure, let's stick together.","4":"What do you think, Lucia?"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"This way, with the help of Gray Raven, we can better handle any emergencies that might arise."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"It's not safe to split up. Commandant, we should go with Chrome and his team."},{"T":"301","3":"An almost animalistic siren peals through the ship, drowning out everyone's voices and the jitters of the crewmates."},{"T":"301","2":"Crew Member","3":"Docking time!"}]
