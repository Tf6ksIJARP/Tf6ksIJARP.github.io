More and more people join the retreating forces; they abandon the well-constructed defense lines and conservation areas, moving the frontline back."},{"T":"301","3":"To live, people are giving up on the rebuilt houses, the unwieldy weapons, and the stored rations. Everything they built is now given up for survival; all they can do now is search for survivors."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"Numb, Liv drags an injured survivor forward."},{"T":"301","3":"Even though her frame is almost entirely spent in the previous fight, Liv is still pushing herself to go forward."},{"T":"301","3":"Every step she is taking stresses her frame. The feeling of pain spreads from her feet to her entire body, but that does not stop her from moving forward."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"How many has there been..."},{"T":"301","3":"After settling \u3010kuroname\u3011 and the rest, Liv returns to the front of the rescue line."},{"T":"301","3":"Her mind is way too foggy to know how many times she has performed first-aid and moved the wounded."},{"T":"301","2":"Wounded Survivor","3":"I... need water..."},{"T":"301","3":"The survivor makes a plea. His voice was weak, but resolute in his last request. Hearing that, Liv immediately takes him to one of the last few water supply points within the ruins."},{"T":"301","3":"But the water at the supply point is already murky and stained. The survivor on her shoulders never got to take a sip of water from his homeland before he passes."},{"T":"301","3":"They were talking just a second ago. Now, they are a life apart."},{"T":"301","3":"In the blink of an eye, a life passes away next to Liv, quietly."},{"T":"301","3":"Even with all the treatment she can do, Liv still cannot save this life from the call of death."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Ugh..."},{"T":"301","3":"Ever since she has become a medic, Liv has been in the company of death. She should be used to the fact that she cannot save everyone by now."},{"T":"301","3":"But, regrettably, she can still remember every name on the casualty list and the desperation she felt as they passed. In the face of death, Liv cannot become accustomed to it."},{"T":"301","3":"The wounded cannot wait.

I want to go home..."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"That's alright. Don't be afraid... I'm taking you home..."},{"T":"301","3":"Seeing the girl's face, Liv remembers a past memory."},{"T":"301","3":"In the memory, Liv was lowering her voice to comfort the girl before her, as Liv was the last one facing the massive Corrupted that destroyed the city."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Stay quiet. I'll count to three, and you run toward the hill, okay?"},{"T":"301","3":"The girl looked at Liv and nodded."},{"T":"301","3":"In that distant past, the army was also retreating like they are now, giving up on the districts one after another."},{"T":"301","3":"During that retreat, Liv saved the little girl that was at a similar age to when Liv enlisted, adorned with silver hair like her."},{"T":"301","3":"As she sees the girl who got turned into a Construct and got injured on the battlefield of despair, Liv begins to feel a sense of familiarity. A question rises in her mind."},{"T":"301","3":"Did I really save her...?"},{"T":"301","3":"The last time she saw the girl, she was alive, direct in her expressions and fear."},{"T":"301","3":"This time, she is another chilling Construct like her, having trekked through countless battlefields."},{"T":"301","3":"Having saved her from a hopeless battlefield, Liv has delivered her to countless wars to confront death."},{"T":"301","3":"What will she think when she is about to die?

The farmers are gone. The farms are lost."},{"T":"301","3":"That bag is damaged by the fire of war, the seeds soaked in blood and fuel."},{"T":"301","3":"Liv looks at the hills of remains before her."},{"T":"301","3":"She knows this scene exists not only here."},{"T":"301","3":"The cities and defense lines lost all look the same in the transmissions."},{"T":"301","3":"Humanity is once again connected: Akdilek, the Forsaken, ARU, and the countless Scavengers... not by hope, but by the desperation that the Punishing Virus has brought."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Can we really fix this now...?"},{"T":"301","3":"There is a higher mountain after this one."},{"T":"301","3":"Another battlefield after this war is over."},{"T":"301","3":"As long as the Punishing Virus exists on Earth, nothing will be fixed."},{"T":"301","3":"It is a Sisyphean struggle, where momentary calmness is easily shattered the next moment."},{"T":"301","3":"How will humanity break this endless cycle?"}]
