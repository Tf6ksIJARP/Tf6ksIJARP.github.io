That way, even if we can't establish a connection, we'll still have a copy of the data in the conservation area."},{"T":"301","2":"Palex","3":"Then we'll release the two drones we brought to capture imagery and energy readings on 'Luna' from as many angles as possible."},{"T":"301","2":"Norwell","3":"...Then what?"},{"T":"301","2":"Palex","3":"What else is there? All we can do is wait on Babylonia."},{"T":"301","2":"Norwell","3":"But..."},{"T":"301","2":"Palex","3":"Don't think that you can be a hero just because you have special equipment."},{"T":"301","2":"Palex","3":"We need to send the correct data to Babylonia instead of getting killed here."},{"T":"301","2":"Norwell","3":"...Roger that."},{"T":"301","3":"Even though Luna has already destroyed most of the port area with her display of power, this also gives the people in the settlement enough of a warning to assemble their forces."},{"T":"301","3":"Though Luna is nowhere to be seen for the Arctic dwellers, with the havoc she has wreaked, it is more than enough to throw the settlement into chaos."},{"T":"301","2":"Guard","3":"What's going on!

Kaplan! Where do you think you're going?"},{"T":"301","2":"Research Director","3":"Are you joking?

I don't know what you're up against, but it has nothing to do with me."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"...Damn you!

Do as you please. I'm leaving."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"...Coward."},{"T":"301","3":"Hearing Staessen's response, the research director gives him a menacing glare, then turns to leave."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"Captain..."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"...I'm sorry you had to see that. Anyways, let's do all we can."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"And he reminded me... The walls of the institute are interlayed with armor for defense purposes. He has a key to open the armored door, but so do I."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"If he doesn't care, neither do I... If we can't maintain the defensive line, then we will retreat into the research institute as well."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"...Understood. What about the elderly and children who have difficulty moving?"},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"Evacuate them to the refugee shelters beneath the old theater. The three rooms should be able to comfortably hold over a hundred people."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"If we win, we'll let them out. If we lose... Someone will let them out, eventually."},{"T":"301","2":"Sailor","3":"...That's the best we can do."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"Damn it, why do I still gotta foot the bill for this mess..."},{"T":"301","3":"(30 minutes later.)"},{"T":"301","3":"The battle has ended before it even begins, leaving Staessen stupefied over their current situation."},{"T":"301","3":"All they can see are melted buildings, punctured steel, exploded ammunition, and bodies evaporated by light."},{"T":"301","3":"They do not even know how the barricades and bunkers disintegrated, or how that devastating white light melted half of the air control tower like butter."},{"T":"301","3":"Staessen and all of those still standing could do nothing but retreat to the safety of the research institute."},{"T":"301","3":"The white figure maintains pursuit, never too far, never too close. Why is she here? What for? Staessen no longer cares anymore. He has long since lost the strength to do so."},{"T":"301","3":"Living\u2014that is the only concern in his mind right now."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"Let's go!"},{"T":"301","2":"Second Mate","3":"Retreat into the bunker!"},{"T":"301","3":"Amid flames and explosions, the group moves along the ruins for cover all the way to the nearby research institute."},{"T":"301","2":"Second Mate","3":"Captain... What are we going to do when we get there? We don't stand a chance against her."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"Heh... That Kaplan won't stay calm."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"As soon as danger approaches, he'll play the ace up his sleeve."},{"T":"301","3":"Then, just like Staessen foretold, several turrets and missile launchers protrude from the wall of the institute and begin firing at Luna. Explosions and smoke envelop her in an instant."},{"T":"301","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"The turrets continue to bombard the area in an unending stream of explosions."},{"T":"301","2":"Second Mate","3":"Captain? What do we do now?"},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"What else is there to do? While they're busy fighting, we run."},{"T":"301","3":"As the bombardment continues, Staessen and the others make their way to the research institute entrance. Staessen inputs the key code, then everyone enters the elevator and proceeds underground."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"Alright, we'll be safe underground."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"Once the fighting is over outside, we'll look for Kaplan... Then we'll make him pay\u2014slowly."},{"T":"301","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"Captain..."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"Yes?"},{"T":"301","2":"Second Mate","3":"Where... are we?"},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"This is the safest place in the entire research institute and where the armor plating is thickest. This place isn't on the map."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"...It's where the institute conducted preliminary screenings for test subjects. In other words, it's an... execution chamber."},{"T":"301","2":"Second Mate","3":"...What did you say?"},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"See these pillars? Kaplan and the others tell them that this is the 'Reception Hall of Peace'. When the time comes, test subjects were taken into the sealed observation room and then... injected with experimental drugs."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"Just like that, they would filter out the most suitable test subjects from over 200 people to proceed onto the next phase."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"That Kaplan must be in the observation room as we speak."},{"T":"301","2":"Second Mate","3":"Captain, how do you know this place so well? Did you..."},{"T":"301","3":"The second mate begins to raise his voice, but Staessen rushes over to cover his mouth."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"Shhh...! Quiet! He's busy dealing with that monster right now. He won't have the time to check what's going on behind the observation room... So, we can sneak in once the battle subsides. Got it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Second Mate","3":"Mm! Mm..."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"Keep quiet, and I'll let go."},{"T":"301","2":"Second Mate","3":"...How much do you really know?"},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"Well, I... I didn't help them kill anyone."},{"T":"301","2":"Second Mate","3":"...When this is all over, Captain, you have a lot to confess."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Second Mate","3":"What's that?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"This can't be..."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"There... There are six floors of armored plating disguised as steel structures... Even railguns shouldn't be able to..."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"...What on Earth are we up against..."},{"T":"301","2":"Second Mate","3":"It's coming from the wall in the direction of the observation room!"},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"Hurry! Hide behind the pillars!"},{"T":"301","3":"Just as Staessen and the others hide behind the pillars, the wall in the direction of the observation room begins to glow red and blister right before their eyes."},{"T":"301","3":"Then an explosion shoots fragments throughout the hall like a shotgun blast. The three pillars take the brunt of the damage."},{"T":"301","3":"A black mass is thrown into the hall as the terrifying and familiar white figure floats in."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"(...It's Kaplan!)"},{"T":"301","3":"The remaining half of the man thrown onto the ground is wrapped in a white coat, lying amid the wreckage of concrete and steel."},{"T":"301","2":"Research Director","3":"Huff, puff..."},{"T":"301","2":"Research Director","3":"What...

You know it is meaningless."},{"T":"301","3":"Having said that, Luna makes no attempt at stopping the desperately crawling man. Nor does she even aim the railgun at him.
