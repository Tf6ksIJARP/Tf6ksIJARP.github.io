All moving parts on my body are rubbing and ringing due to inexplicable anxiety."},{"T":"304","1":"It needs a core. If possible, I will even dedicate myself to it if need be. But I must witness Ascnet's move toward the future with my own eyes."},{"T":"304","1":"Lamia is no good. Roland still has value. Under his guidance, Alpha hasn't questioned our plan."},{"T":"304","1":"...Alpha."},{"T":"304","1":"His ability to sway the will of the agent is valuable in and of itself."},{"T":"304","1":"A most suitable choice."},{"T":"304","1":"As long as I show Luna the power of the Hetero-Creatures I created, she will definitely agree with my plan and approach."},{"T":"304","1":"If not..."},{"T":"304","1":"I already have a backup plan."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"No... don't kill me, please! I have no choice..."},{"T":"301","3":"With mud on his face, the refugee cowers in terror in the corner, watching the dark shadows gradually approaching him."},{"T":"301","3":"Three armed Scavengers stand in a circle and point their weapons at him."},{"T":"301","2":"Beardy","3":"Who would've thought. What makes you think you can steal from the likes of us?"},{"T":"301","2":"Kordes","3":"Watch out. Look at his bandages. He's probably showing symptoms of corruption."},{"T":"301","2":"Zack","3":"Come on, see what else we can find from this guy. We gotta run."},{"T":"301","2":"Zack","3":"We're at least four or five days of walk away from the nearest conservation area, and it would be very difficult to travel during the night. We can't afford to waste our time here."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"W-wait! I... I have stuff I can give you! Don't k-kill me!"},{"T":"301","3":"Escaping the hand of the Scavenger who was about to tear his cloak, the raggedly dressed refugee trembles as he empties the contents of his backpack."},{"T":"301","3":"The things in his bag drop one after another. A few tins and hardtacks fall next to the Scavengers' feet. There is also a small unused bandage roll, alcohol, several magazines, a picture frame with a blurred photo, and a broken walkie-talkie."},{"T":"301","2":"Beardy","3":"Hmph, looks like you still got a lot there."},{"T":"301","3":"Beardy kicks the frame away and, after checking them, puts the food, bandages, and magazines in his backpack before he gives a wink to Zack."},{"T":"301","3":"Zack nods and hits the refugee's arms, which are holding his bag tightly, hard with the butt of his gun. The refugee cries in pain and lets go of the bag."},{"T":"301","3":"Beardy immediately picks up the bag that falls at his feet with a dagger. It's a heavy bag. He sneers and drops the bag to the ground. Inside the bag is an iron box wrapped tightly in cloth and covered with a large brown stain."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Ugh...!"},{"T":"301","3":"Seeing them notice that he was trying to hide something, the refugee trembles and lowers his head even more."},{"T":"301","2":"Beardy","3":"Come on, fella. Still holding out on us?"},{"T":"301","2":"Zack","3":"What's this? Come over here and open it yourself. No funny business."},{"T":"301","3":"The refugee immediately crawls over, reaching out to open the seal on the edge of the iron box. His hands are wrapped in soiled bandages and his fingertips keep slipping from the edge of the box."},{"T":"301","3":"Seeing the refugee's hesitant and clumsy appearance, Zack gives an impatient grunt."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"S... Sorry... I hurt my hand. I'll open it right away... right away."},{"T":"301","3":"The seal is picked off little by little, and the iron box opens with a click, revealing the contents."},{"T":"301","3":"After the white fog formed by the cold air dissipates, the Scavengers see three complete doses of serum lying in the grooves of the iron box. It even comes with a syringe, on which the logo of the World Government is clearly visible."},{"T":"301","2":"Beardy","3":"Zackpot... Look what we got here. It's serum. Zack, you..."},{"T":"301","2":"Zack","3":"Shut up."},{"T":"301","2":"Kordes","3":"...And not just any serum. This is a World Government symbol, and it's a special military serum, which is more effective than the civilian one."},{"T":"301","2":"Zack","3":"...It's also rarer, and even we don't have access to it."},{"T":"301","2":"'Beardy'","3":"Such a nice little treasure you got here, and you try to steal our supplies? Is it true that people die for money and birds die for food?"},{"T":"301","2":"Zack&Kordes","3":"\u2026\u2026"},{"T":"301","3":"Despite accidentally ridiculing everyone present, Beardy is unaware of it. He just sighs and puts the serum into his own bag."},{"T":"301","3":"Zack ignores his mentally incompetent companions, squats down next to the trembling refugee and speaks quietly."},{"T":"301","2":"Zack","3":"Tell us. Where'd you get it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Zack","3":"The CPF?"},{"T":"301","3":"The refugee vigorously nods, and subtly tries to move to the side."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"There's a forest park nearby. T-there's the CPF. No one's there."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"There's tons of supplies there... There's a lot more in a giant crate. It has the World Government's logo. B-but it's too heavy. I-I couldn't carry it..."},{"T":"301","3":"The refugee's words were like telling a group of travelers wandering the desert about a nearby oasis. Too coincidental yet too alluring, the trio pauses in silent contemplation."},{"T":"301","3":"Someone speaks up after a while."},{"T":"301","2":"Zack","3":"...What do you guys think?"},{"T":"301","2":"Kordes","3":"Something's fishy here. A well-supplied place like that would have been raided already."},{"T":"301","2":"Kordes","3":"...But if there really are a lot of supplies like he said, I think it's worth checking out. We're running low as is."},{"T":"301","2":"Beardy","3":"Are you sure? Even if those supplies do exist, can we really get them? What if it's a trap?"},{"T":"301","2":"Beardy","3":"We got similar info about the reconstruction supplies dumped by a group, remember? You insisted to go and check it out!"},{"T":"301","2":"'Beardy'","3":"What happened when we got there? Nothing but that damn Red Tide and crazy idiots who jumped into it. We were a man down, and Zack almost..."},{"T":"301","2":"Kordes","3":"But Zack is still alive. And because we passed City 075 on the way out, we got the news about the refugee transfer and the establishment of a conservation area in Babylonia."},{"T":"301","2":"Kordes","3":"If you hadn't been taking your sweet *** time on the way there, we may have made it in time for the last transport craft."},{"T":"301","2":"'Beardy'","3":"You think that was MY fault?!"},{"T":"301","2":"'Beardy'","3":"Ha! If it wasn't for the supplies I found, we wouldn't even BE here!"},{"T":"301","2":"Zack","3":"Knock it off."},{"T":"301","3":"Irritated, Zack commands them to stop. 'Beardy' is just about to muster up a retort, but shuts his mouth upon seeing Zack's expression. He grips the handle of his knife hanging down at his side even more tightly."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"\u2026\u2026"},{"T":"301","3":"Zack pulls out a map and spreads it out on the floor."},{"T":"301","2":"Zack","3":"Where exactly is the CPF?"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Go northwest from here and then down the road, and you'll find it soon!"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"I swear! I'm not lying!"},{"T":"301","3":"Zack's fingers cross the map in the direction refugee is pointing, then stops at a place marked as 'Pulia Forest Park'."},{"T":"301","2":"Zack","3":"... Central Purification Filter 040. Depending on our travel speed and road conditions, it should take us about three to four days to get there."},{"T":"301","2":"Zack","3":"He wasn't lying about the location of the tower."},{"T":"301","2":"Beardy","3":"You're not seriously thinking of going, are you?"},{"T":"301","2":"Zack","3":"With the supplies we have now, we wouldn't make it to the conservation area. Kordes, how many medical supplies do we have now?"},{"T":"301","3":"Kordes hesitates for a moment before speaking again."},{"T":"301","2":"Kordes","3":"We used our last vial of serum yesterday."},{"T":"301","2":"Kordes","3":"...Recently, we've been taking too many detours to avoid high concentration areas. We've used too much of our supplies this week."},{"T":"301","2":"Zack","3":"Even if there are no supplies in the CPF, we can cross the park in this direction and continue north to find the conservation area."},{"T":"301","2":"Zack","3":"From the moment we left the base, there was no turning back."},{"T":"301","3":"Zack puts the map back into his bag, stands up, and aims his gun at the refugee who had quietly stepped back several meters."},{"T":"301","2":"Zack","3":"You lead the way."},{"T":"301","3":"Seeing the dark muzzle aimed right at him, the refugee instantly puts his hands up as if struck by lightning. But after hearing Zack, he shows obvious hesitation."},{"T":"301","2":"Beardy","3":"What's wrong? Think we got all day? Move it."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"There... Over there..."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"But there are monsters. And Corrupted. It's dangerous..."},{"T":"301","3":"The refugee shivers and points into the distance, where a faint green line beyond the city is seen far across the horizon."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"That park... has a lot of Corrupted in it."},{"T":"301","2":"Zack","3":"If that's the case, how'd you get out?"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"I..."},{"T":"301","2":"Beardy","3":"What a wimp... We've taken all his supplies. I don't think he'll survive on his own. Shall we rub him out here?"},{"T":"301","3":"'Beardy' spins a knife around his fingers and grins."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"D-don't! Don't kill me! I, I know how to get there! I've been there several times. I'm the only one who knows a safe route!"},{"T":"301","2":"Zack","3":"Any funny games, and you know what'll happen next."},{"T":"301","2":"Zack","3":"Clean up and prepare to move out, 'Beardy'. Also, take out all of the supplies. Don't think I didn't see that."},{"T":"301","2":"Beardy","3":"Okay."},{"T":"301","3":"Beardy takes the ammo and medical supplies from his bag, hands them to Zack and Kordus respectively, then shows Zack the contents of the bag."},{"T":"301","2":"'Beardy'","3":"That's all. I'm in charge of all the food. Don't say I'm being selfish."},{"T":"301","2":"Zack","3":"Alright, let's hit the road, and..."},{"T":"301","3":"Zack furrows his eyebrows."},{"T":"301","2":"Zack","3":"What's your name?"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Huh?"},{"T":"301","2":"Zack","3":"I said, what's your name?"},{"T":"301","3":"Who cares about the name of a dirty thief. No one seems to ever ask him this question, catching him off guard."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"I..."},{"T":"301","3":"Like attempting to swallow with a dry mouth, the refugee answers with some difficulty."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Rolmo... My name's Rolmo."},{"T":"301","2":"Zack","3":"Alright, Rolmo. You take the lead."},{"T":"301","2":"Zack","3":"Try to escape, we'll see which is faster\u2014your legs or my bullet."},{"T":"301","3":"Forced to take the lead, the refugee hunches forward. With his back to the Scavengers, the timid look on his face disappears without a trace."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"\u2026\u2026"},{"T":"301","3":"His dichromatic eyes obscured in shadow narrow slightly as if 'Rolmo' is lost in contemplation."},{"T":"301","3":"Normally, Scavengers act in a group. Their supplies are distributed evenly and they can decide what to do with their own rations."},{"T":"301","3":"But these people ask different men to keep different supplies. One person keeps all the medical supplies, one keeps all the food, and one keeps all the weapons and ammunition."},{"T":"301","3":"This way, the group forms an invisible chain from which no one can break away. Otherwise, they cannot live on just one form of supplies."},{"T":"301","3":"In the apocalyptic wasteland with no stable access to materials, losing food means difficulty in moving forward. Losing medical supplies means endless pain and infections. Losing weaponry means the lack of defense when surrounded by Corrupted. Whichever it is, death would be the final destination."},{"T":"301","3":"Everyone has the lifeblood of the team, which makes it impossible for them to turn against each other and leave the team by themselves."},{"T":"301","3":"This isn't stupid or clever, but one thing for certain is that they couldn't trust each other from the start. So they came up with this way to restrain each other."},{"T":"301","3":"Such a classic configuration, Roland can only imagine how the team will end up."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"(...Looks like it's going to end as it always does.)"}]
