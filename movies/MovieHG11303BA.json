A form of vital fluid additive...'"},{"T":"301","3":"'Has stimulative properties for the M.I.N.D. of a Construct.

What for, Commandant?"},{"T":"302","2":"Just curious."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Let's see. It's essentially a sensory amplifying drug for Constructs. Through stimulating the sympathetic ganglia of the M.I.N.D., a Construct's sensory inputs can be amplified in a short amount of time."},{"T":"302","2":"What's the catch?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"It amplifies mostly negative sensory information... Like pain, or emotional fluctuations\u2014magnifying them several-fold."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"In a way, it does force a Construct conscious through pain...

I don't know if you've heard, Commandant... But two squads have taken heavy casualties... Aside from the confirmed deaths, there are still many MIA..."},{"T":"302","2":"I've heard."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Command seems to value the info from this operation greatly.
