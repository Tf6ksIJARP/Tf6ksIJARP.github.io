One arm is broken, causing his attacks to look like comedic flails."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Just one... If I could save just this one..."},{"T":"301","3":"In a flash, Vera slashes through the horde of Corrupted moving toward her and rushes to the familiar construct, supporting his sagging form."},{"T":"301","3":"Being a support-type Construct after all, Vera can feel her combat computation modules reaching their max capacity."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Hey, Average Joe. You're an Attacker-type, right?"},{"T":"301","2":"Familiar Construct","3":"Yeah... No need to rub it in, I'm an Attacker-type, but you fight better than\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"His speech is interrupted by a brief, metallic screech. Vera has yanked off one of her arms and is hurriedly attaching it to the Construct in the place of his broken limb via nano-reinforcement."},{"T":"301","2":"Familiar Construct","3":"You..."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"I'm reaching the limits of my battle capabilities. I'm a Support-type by design, after all. You can still fight if you've got your structure intact, right?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"...If just one person survives... I'll no longer have to hear the nickname 'Death'."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Use my arm to get past the defense and leave!

It hurts deeper than the pain in my receptors right now..."},{"T":"301","2":"Familiar Construct","3":"But well... I guess being able to feel pain is what proves that we're still alive."},{"T":"301","2":"Familiar Construct","3":"...Watch out!"},{"T":"301","3":"Vera is suddenly doused with a faceful of ice-cold vital fluid. She pauses mending the limb of the Construct."},{"T":"301","3":"Before the Construct is crushed, he has swung his intact arm into the core of the culprit\u2014a towering Corrupted that leapt into sight out of nowhere\u2014effectively crippling it."},{"T":"301","2":"Familiar Construct","3":"Live."},{"T":"301","3":"The words reach Vera before he crumbles into lifeless parts.

Vera sprints out with her blades."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Damn it... damn it!"},{"T":"301","3":"Even as she fights, Vera no longer feels alive. Were she to live through this, only more fear and pain await."},{"T":"301","3":"One after another, the Corrupted land their blows on her. Once, twice... with every new mark on her body, the pain intensifies."},{"T":"301","3":"The exhausted Vera kneels down on the remains of countless Corrupted and Constructs.

The screams of the devoured civilians, too, flood into her being."},{"T":"301","3":"The living feel pain, but not mere things. Lifeless things are without form, without self, devoid of everything."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"You're right, Average Joe! At least I'm able to feel!"},{"T":"301","3":"Unlike mere things, she can feel pain. Even the pain of others, too."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Ahaha, it hurts... it really fricking hurts... bastards!"},{"T":"301","3":"For a brief moment, Vera allows the swirling pain to stir in her head, enjoying it as if it were some kind of reward."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"All right! I'll live! I'll live, and feel the pain that you cannot feel! I'll pillage all that you'll never own again!"},{"T":"301","3":"Meanwhile, a Kurono transportation truck arrives and parks soundlessly at the extraction point."},{"T":"301","3":"The Kurono personnel are patrolling the battlefield, seeking for what they deem valuable among the remains of Constructs, humans and Corrupted."},{"T":"301","3":"A short series of mechanical scraping attracts the attention of some of the workers. Amidst the sand and corpses, there is a girl lying silently on the ground with her heavily damaged blade, missing limbs and all."},{"T":"301","3":"Her red bangs, wet from vital fluid, barely conceal a pair of sparkling eyes. She is grinning a wide, unhinged smile\u2014a ghoulish sight contrasting the dead bodies surrounding her. She is smiling, just like Death herself."},{"T":"301","3":"And what better a recommendation letter, than the heaps of Corrupted bodies beside her?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Let me... live."},{"T":"301","3":"With her still intact vocal modules, she whispers."},{"T":"301","2":"Kurono Officer","3":"Version BPN-13, Support-type Construct.
