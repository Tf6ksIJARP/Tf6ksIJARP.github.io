Where's Commandant?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"You idiot... Are you trying to attract all the Corrupted?"},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"With the available strength we have now, it won't be that much of a problem."},{"T":"301","2":"Ayla","3":"I never knew this side of you."},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"I'm too used to this kind of situation.
