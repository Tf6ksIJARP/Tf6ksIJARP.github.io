[{"T":"304","1":"Day 35."},{"T":"304","1":"I saw a building collapse today. Perhaps the concrete underwent some chemical reaction due to the temperature change."},{"T":"304","1":"I was... (Static)... patrolling aimlessly when I heard the sound of glass shattering."},{"T":"304","1":"Not long after that, a window wall snapped and dropped vertically onto the pavement."},{"T":"304","1":"Afterward, there was like a gentle push from a pair of invisible hands..."},{"T":"304","1":"And the building fell like a domino. Shards spattered everywhere, carried by a gust of wind."},{"T":"304","1":"I suddenly wondered how long it took the people who lived there to build this towering structure. Nature reclaimed it in but a second."},{"T":"304","1":"Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust."},{"T":"301","3":"Snow covers everything as far as they can see, and high-rises and roadside structures are buried beneath unmelting ice. Human settlements are ruined beyond recognition."},{"T":"301","3":"This is the first time Sniper-PK43 leaves his building. Walking in the city he was once tasked to guard, he creates a little white mist with every step he takes as his legs press and lifts the quiet, unmoving snow."},{"T":"301","3":"Carefully he walks as if afraid of ruining the planet he sets foot on. Then he finds a giant wave of snow coming from the highway before him."},{"T":"301","2":"??","3":"Awoooo\u2014!"},{"T":"301","2":"??","3":"The inspectors are here to catch naughty kids!"},{"T":"301","3":"A suffocating mech approaches Sniper-PK43 as he hears a girl's voice above it."},{"T":"301","2":"Sniper","3":"Is this what you wanted to show me?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Indeed! Isn't it cool?"},{"T":"301","2":"Sniper","3":"I couldn't detect you even when you rode this monstrosity into my range. What exactly are you..."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"I told you. Nanami is Nanami!"},{"T":"301","2":"Sniper","3":"Where did you find this, anyway?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"You mean Power?"},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami slaps the mech underneath her."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Nanami doesn't know either. Power was here when I arrived here."},{"T":"301","2":"Sniper","3":"And you gave it a weird name... It is a shame it cannot speak for itself."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Doesn't its name sound powerful? Nanami spent a long time before coming up with it!"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Nanami chooses the form of Power!"},{"T":"301","3":"With Nanami's nonsensical command, the mech begins to tread forward with its giant steps."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"What should we do next...?"},{"T":"301","2":"Sniper","3":"You said you would help me find my maker, but you have no idea how to do it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"We'll figure it out! Nanami has solved many problems on her journey, so don't you worry! I'll be able to help you with this!"},{"T":"301","3":"There is nothing Sniper-PK43 can do but follow the mech-riding girl silently on this aimless journey."},{"T":"301","3":"They walk past three seemingly identical blocks, where the sights are as they appeared back when Sniper-PK43 saw them on his roof\u2014dreary and lifeless."},{"T":"301","3":"They enter the buildings that have yet to collapse, searching for any sign of human activities, but they always leave empty-handed."},{"T":"301","3":"Perhaps this is the end of the world, Sniper-PK43 thinks, and the soldier and he are the two remaining beings in this world\u2014an enlarged version of their roof."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Hey, look... There's something ahead...!"},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami screams after they cross a sparse wood."},{"T":"301","3":"What catches Nanami's attention is a building barely visible ahead of them. Unlike the structures in previous areas, it is not covered in snow but a giant white dome, and figures, seemingly mechanoids, scatter around the place."},{"T":"301","2":"Sniper","3":"Hold on, let's make sure they are not Corrupted..."},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami charges forward with Power, and Sniper-PK43 has no choice but to follow. At the base of the building is a mechanoid clearing the remaining snow. It stops when it notices Nanami approaching, and the monitor above its head glows yellow."},{"T":"301","3":"After a second, it speaks."},{"T":"301","2":"Mechanoid","3":"Guests! Guests!"},{"T":"301","3":"With that, other mechanoids of different models and shapes around it also stop their work and pass along the phrase. 'Guests! Guests!' The line echoes among the machines, spreading to the entire area."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"How welcoming!"},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami jumps off Power's back and steps forward. She is greeted by an adorable robot."},{"T":"301","2":"Snowball","3":"Hello! My name is Snowball. Welcome to the House of Love! This is a charming neighborhood designed for humans. Are you here to visit?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"There are still communities like this around? That's wonderful! Nanami is searching for a human. Do you have humans here?"},{"T":"301","2":"Snowball","3":"There are currently no humans living in this neighborhood..."},{"T":"301","3":"The small robot droops its ears, looking disappointed, but it soon cheers up once again."},{"T":"301","2":"Snowball","3":"But we have been preparing for humanity's arrival. Our site provides first-class services and comes with comprehensive residential and entertainment facilities. Feel free to come in and take a look!"},{"T":"301","3":"Because of the dome, the 'neighborhood' is not covered in snow like its surroundings. Still, the wind has brought snow inside, so plenty of mechanoids are working on clearing the snow and repairing the facilities."},{"T":"301","3":"Sniper-PK43 even sees a bear carrying a large fridge across the road."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"There are so many mechanoids in this place! Have you always been here?"},{"T":"301","2":"Snowball","3":"We all came from different parts of the world, gathering in this place. I was a performer mechanoid in an amusement park, but I led everyone here because we shared the same wish."},{"T":"301","2":"Sniper","3":"What wish is that?"},{"T":"301","2":"Snowball","3":"That humans would return."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Speaking of which, where are all the humans? Nanami hasn't seen a single person on her journey here..."},{"T":"301","2":"Snowball","3":"There have been fewer and fewer humans on the surface ever since the moment it suddenly started snowing. I never saw one again, so I had to leave the park to find another place that would need me..."},{"T":"301","3":"The bear, who is passing by Nanami, also stops."},{"T":"301","2":"Bear","3":"Same here... I was a bionic mechanoid in the ARU. I would help out the fishermen there, unlike the other bears... Ever since the winter came, the Arctic was even colder than before. All the fishermen gradually left."},{"T":"301","2":"Explorer","3":"Happened to me too. I was stationed in the desert, but it became a snowfield by the time I left."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Why has it become like this...?"},{"T":"301","3":"Listening to the mechanoids talking about their experience, Nanami begins to look more and more somber. It seems that extreme weather has not just happened to this city."},{"T":"301","2":"Snowball","3":"We are here. Please come in, dear guests."},{"T":"301","3":"The community leader brings Nanami and Sniper-PK43 to a building, gesturing them to enter."},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami exclaims the moment she steps inside."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Whoa...! I can't believe there's still a place like this! Did you guys make all of these?"},{"T":"301","3":"The hall has been transformed into a tidy, cozy home, with a sofa and a coffee table in the lounge and a play area that is colorful and bright. In the center of the hall is a large machine emitting heat."},{"T":"301","2":"Snowball","3":"We did. I was going to place some plants here, but finding surviving plants is impossible these days..."},{"T":"301","3":"Sniper-PK43 recognizes the plants in the hall are all just replicates made with synthetic polymers."},{"T":"301","3":"The small robot spins around in the hall, introducing each facility to Nanami."},{"T":"301","2":"Snowball","3":"This is our leisure area, where humans can relax and rest."},{"T":"301","2":"Snowball","3":"This is the play area for human children. We thought that if humans visited, they might bring children with them."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Oh my! It's Nanami's favorite arcade!"},{"T":"301","2":"Snowball","3":"Here we have installations modeled after an aquarium. Since we could not find any living fish, our bionic fish are playing the parts for now."},{"T":"301","3":"The small bionic fish inside the tank approaches the glass, tapping tenderly where Nanami places her hand."},{"T":"301","2":"Snowball","3":"We built this 'bonfire' to keep humans warm. We believed humans were gone seeking warmer places because of how cold this place became. As long as we guard this neighborhood, humans will find us and move in."},{"T":"301","3":"As the small robot talks, another mechanoid approaches, holding a tray."},{"T":"301","2":"Martini","3":"Please try our food, esteemed guests."},{"T":"301","2":"Snowball","3":"We are not sure how they taste since none of us have tastebuds... Perhaps you can offer some suggestions, Madam."},{"T":"301","3":"Before Snowball can finish, Nanami has already grabbed the cake from the tray and stuffed it into her mouth."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Nom-nom-nom. Nanami finks dey ah fery tasti!"},{"T":"301","2":"Sniper","3":"Is that really okay..."},{"T":"301","3":"Looking at the girl with her big thumbs-up, Sniper-PK43 can only pretend not to see it and continue searching every corner of the interior."},{"T":"301","3":"After Nanami has experienced all the facilities in a back-to-back mad dash, she crashes on the sofa, too tired to keep going."},{"T":"301","2":"Snowball","3":"How would you rate our service, dear guest?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Fantastic! Nanami is satisfied!"},{"T":"301","3":"Receiving feedback, Snowball jots down some notes seriously."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"What are you doing?"},{"T":"301","2":"Snowball","3":"Recording your feedback. That is how I can continue to improve this place."},{"T":"301","2":"Sniper","3":"She is not a human either..."},{"T":"301","2":"Snowball","3":"For some reason, I have a strange feeling that this madam is someone very special, so her opinions are equally important..."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Of course I'm special! Nanami is Nanami, duh!"},{"T":"301","2":"Snowball","3":"Miss Nanami is like a human to us."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Like a human? Nanami doesn't know anything about that. Anyway, you're all very nice, and I had a great time! There is just one thing!"},{"T":"301","2":"Snowball","3":"Hm...? Is there something we can improve?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"You aren't happy enough! Be happier! Let Nanami give you some pointers in return for your excellent service!"},{"T":"301","2":"Sniper","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"Soon, the wall is adorned with Nanami's colorful graffiti: 'Welcome to the House of Love'. A small troupe of mechanoids led by Snowball is posing before it cheerfully, albeit stiffly."},{"T":"301","2":"Snowball","3":"T-ta-da\u2014welcome to the House of Love!"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Cut! Perfect!"},{"T":"301","3":"Acting as a director, Nanami rubs her chin satisfactorily on the side."},{"T":"301","2":"Snowball","3":"Will this make humans happy?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Ha! Ha! Ha! Of course it will! You all look so warm and adorable! Ten out of ten!"},{"T":"301","2":"Snowball","3":"I still do not comprehend. We are warm? But this room is still far from generating the temperature humans find comfortable..."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"I wasn't talking about the temperature. I meant you are welcoming and affectionate..."},{"T":"301","3":"Gently, she holds Snowball's head in her hands."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"You send your love to the other person, and the other person will feel warm and fuzzy inside!"},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami touches Snowball's forehead with hers. Like a ritual, the small robot seems to be able to receive Nanami's 'love' in silence."},{"T":"301","2":"Snowball","3":"I see... Is this warmth?"},{"T":"301","2":"Snowball","3":"Thank you, Miss Nanami..."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"You're welcome! Hehe, this is what Nanami ought to do!"},{"T":"301","2":"Snowball","3":"Alright then, we shall put rehearsal into our daily maintenance routine. We will keep working hard, Miss Nanami."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Good! I believe there will be humans here one day!"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"We've been here for a while now..."},{"T":"301","2":"Sniper","3":"There are no signs of human activity here. We should go."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"I know, I know!"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Nanami planned to continue her journey anyway. So, this is where we say goodbye."},{"T":"301","2":"Snowball","3":"Is that so... If it were not for the other mechanoids here, I would have joined you in your search for humans."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"You can! Nanami would love to have you join us!"},{"T":"301","2":"Snowball","3":"But I will never get to see the humans who find our neighborhood if I leave. It is my duty to make humans feel at home. I shall continue to guard this place until the day I can no longer lead us."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Nanami feels so moved..."},{"T":"301","2":"Sniper","3":"Please refrain from wiping your snot and tears on me, especially when we do not know what they are made of."},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami waves goodbye to the mechanoids at the entrance of the community."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"You've all done a great job!"},{"T":"301","2":"Snowball","3":"Goodbye, Miss Nanami. Thank you for your feedback. Please visit us soon!"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Woohoo\u2014! Nanami had a great time!"},{"T":"301","3":"That is when Nanami and Sniper-PK43 realize it is already nighttime outside."},{"T":"301","3":"The wind seems to be stronger at night, pulling more snow into the 'neighborhood.' Whirling inside the dome, it almost sounds like it is wailing."},{"T":"301","2":"Sniper","3":"What is wrong?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Nothing. It's just... the wind sounds like it's crying."},{"T":"301","3":"Longingly, Nanami places her hand on the building's wall as if feeling something."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Snipey, once we found your maker, Commandant, and the others, we'll tell all of them about this neighborhood!"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Then, this will truly become a happy place."},{"T":"301","2":"Sniper","3":"What is a 'Commandant'?"},{"T":"301","2":"Sniper","3":"And were you not happy?"},{"T":"301","3":"Sniper-PK43 is surprised to hear what he said. He does not understand what 'happiness' is, but he unintentionally interprets Nanami's behavior as a human."},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami smiles."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"It's because I saw how everyone still remains hopeful, and that hope, in return, continues to push them forward. That's why I'm happy!"},{"T":"301","3":"She waves, and the mech waiting outside the dome seems to feel her longing and walks toward her."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Let's keep going, Snipey."},{"T":"301","3":"Miles away from the neighborhood, Nanami and Sniper-PK43 look down as they\u2014technically, just Nanami\u2014lie on a plateau. They can still see the bright and empty city in the distance as if it is the only star in the silent night."},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami raises her hand to block away the snow falling on her face. Through the gap between her fingers, she looks at the lonely neighborhood."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Do you like it there, Snipey?"},{"T":"301","2":"Sniper","3":"...Are you referring to that community? It does not mean anything in particular to me."},{"T":"301","3":"Eventually, Nanami puts down her sore arm and blinks, staring at the flashing phantoms the bright stars left in her eyes."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"For a second, Nanami doesn't know where she is..."},{"T":"301","3":"She flips over on the ground and extends her arms, burying her face in the snow as if she is embracing the earth."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Even though Nanami has always traveled alone since she left home, I never felt lonely."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"But now... for some reason..."},{"T":"301","3":"She pats the ground gently, and the snow splashes onto Sniper-PK43."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Alright, alright... Please stop being upset if you're mad, granny earth..."},{"T":"301","2":"Sniper","3":"Are you trying to comfort earth for real?"},{"T":"301","3":"The girl, with her head in the snow, replies, but her words are all muffled."},{"T":"301","2":"Sniper","3":"Although my database is not updated, I know that... Earth is strong. Stronger than any human or mechanoid."},{"T":"301","3":"As he speaks, his motion sensor captures a strangely-shaped red deer dashing through the night. Creatures other than humans seem to have started to adapt to the environment."},{"T":"301","3":"Sniper-PK43 cannot help but wonder."},{"T":"301","3":"Are there... still humans on this planet?"}]
