[{"T":"301","2":"Villager","3":"Sorry for attacking you. It was a misunderstanding. It's really kind of you to escort us back."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"No problem. We wanted to come here in the first place."},{"T":"301","3":"After clearing up the misunderstanding, three of them moved together with the villagers and returned to the village after defeating nearby Demons."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"The stone monument said humans had already defeated the Demons. Why were those Demons still so aggressive?"},{"T":"301","2":"Villager","3":"It was the King who defeated them, not us. The Demons were just retaliating..."},{"T":"301","2":"Villager","3":"The war was supposed to have ended when the last generation of heroes defeated the Demon King. But the King back then claimed that he would wipe out all the Demons."},{"T":"301","2":"Villager","3":"He turned the war into a tradition. That's why the Demons keep striking back..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"What a foolish king... What can he possibly get from endless wars?"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Hmm... I think that's just the setting of this game. Don't spend too much time trying to figure it out."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Are you that type of gamer who would give a score of 10 to every single game..."},{"T":"301","2":"Villager","3":"You said you were heading here. What are you up to?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"We are looking for our friend."},{"T":"301","2":"Villager","3":"Friend... Do you mean those heroes who raided the other village?"},{"T":"301","3":"The villagers looked a bit scared talking about them. Looked like Vera's team had become more terrifying than the Demons."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"No, we are looking for another teammate. Her name is Liv, has short hair. Unlike us, she can float in the air..."},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia told the villagers everything she could think of Liv, but they still had no clue."},{"T":"301","2":"Villager","3":"I have met many young girls, but none of them looked like what you described..."},{"T":"301","2":"Villager","3":"Hey, has any one of you seen her?"},{"T":"301","3":"The villager asked others but got no reply."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"I don't think we are going to find anything useful here, except that the King might be a bad guy."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Thinking about it, Liv might be taken by the King. Given he's that type of guy who always causes conflicts, I won't be surprised if he did it."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"But Commandant's team probably had already dealt with the King. I don't know about the others, but Commandant would never join the evil side."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"Plus, Karenina wouldn't be doing nothing if Liv was captured by the King."},{"T":"301","3":"Lucia took a glance at Lee and Kamui."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"I don't know about Vera. I'm not that familiar with her, only worked with her a couple of times."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Camu will probably help Liv... He definitely will."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"So it's three to one. I don't think the King has Liv then."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"They are probably deceived..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"Kamui, do you think there is anyone who can deceive all of them?"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Um... Probably not."},{"T":"301","2":"Villager B","3":"Oh no... Help!"},{"T":"301","3":"A panicking villager suddenly rushed in, interrupting their conversation. He was soaked in sweat."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"What happened?"},{"T":"301","2":"Villager","3":"A child was attacked by the Demons. I couldn't take them all alone. Hurry, take your weapons and follow me!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...Can you still run? Lead the way, we will take care of the child!"},{"T":"301","2":"Villager","3":"Um, but who are you...?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"We are the heroes."}]
