[{"T":"301","3":"After the admin and logistics departments had their food supply cut off, it's the medical department's turn."},{"T":"301","3":"After finishing their last meal, all medical staff gather to the edge of the base. There is an exit that goes directly to the outer sea."},{"T":"301","3":"It's raining outside. The sky is dark and gloomy, just like the future that mankind is about to face."},{"T":"301","3":"The researchers stand in rain, holding umbrellas. In front of the team is Lustrous, as well as Lamia, who has already walked into water."},{"T":"301","3":"The only light on the water comes from the outer buildings of Atlantis in the distance. It looks like wavering fireflies."},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"Lamia, you have proven your value."},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"We have decided to send you into the outer sea."},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"Your duty is to collect data, and come back to notify us if\u2014although quite unlikely\u2014the Punishing disaster has ended and peace is restored to the world."},{"T":"301","2":"Lamia","3":"Will do."},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"That's all. Do you have anything to say?"},{"T":"301","3":"What to say? To whom?"},{"T":"301","3":"Lamia is confused."},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"Looks like you don't. What about you?"},{"T":"301","3":"She turns back and looks at the medical department."},{"T":"301","3":"The medical director takes one step forward."},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"There's nothing else we can do for you. You can go, Lamia."},{"T":"301","3":"Lamia takes a good look at everybody. Behind them is the sky-scraping, metal-gray Atlantis. Its top has almost merged with the dark clouds in the sky."},{"T":"301","3":"She leaps into the sea."},{"T":"301","3":"She makes a big splash, creating ripples on the surface."},{"T":"301","3":"Lamia disappears in the vision before the water settles down. She has left without a moment's hesitation\u2014Atlantis is definitely not a place that she wants to stay."},{"T":"301","3":"Moments later."},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"Ha, ha."},{"T":"301","3":"Lustrous glances at him."},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"What are you laughing about?"},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"Nothing. I just thought of a story in the Bible."},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"When the waters of the Great Flood finally subsided, Noah sent a dove, who later returned with an olive branch. He then knew the ground was dry enough."},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"We just sent out our dove."},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"I'm afraid she won't find the olive branch, and we won't survive till the flood is over."},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"At least we gave her a purpose."},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"I don't think such a frail and weak girl would remember her 'purpose.'"},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"Not necessarily. A purpose is better than none."},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"You have been taking care of that child."},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"Not really taking care. I just kept her healthy."},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"Why? I didn't give that duty to you or anyone else."},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"I don't know either. I just couldn't watch her die."},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"Is that why you prepared the operation for her?"},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"Not entirely. Can I ask why you decided to save her in the first place?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"Because she's a human."},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"It's probably the same reason for me."},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"That child isn't smart. In fact, she is quite dull."},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"Right. She is slow in reaction and very emotional. I see no outstanding potential in her."},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"And very weak. She can't even help in physical duties. It must be exhausting to take care of such an incapable little thing."},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"Not really. To be honest, she is so incapable that she can't even create real troubles."},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"She once stormed my office and shouted at me, because I didn't let her take away a photo of her mother."},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"Did she? But isn't that a normal reaction from a child that misses her mother?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"Maybe. I have been away from a 'normal' human society for too long."},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"There isn't any 'normal' human society left."},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"She does have something we lack."},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"What is it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"Weakness."},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"That isn't good."},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"But that is what defines a 'normal person.' Atlantis is a fortress, and we are prepared to die here fighting. But she... was only involved in this war by accident. She could not choose where she was born and grew up."},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"I once felt that she reminded me of something. Something that I gave up long ago before entering Atlantis."},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"It's strange, isn't it? She was foolish, gutless, hesitant, even stubborn... But we could never give up on her completely and just watch her die."},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"Most people are like that."},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"Which is why the world outside Atlantis has gone to destruction."},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"But we are working here to save the future of those people."},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"The surgery and this 'gather information' purpose... They were just your excuses, weren't they?"},{"T":"301","3":"The Medical Director laughs bitterly."},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"I know I can't hide it from you."},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"The only purpose of that surgery was to make sure she could survive in a world wrecked by the Punishing Virus. There was no other way to save her. She must go out there and survive on her own. It's up to her how far she can get."},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"Sounds like you never expected her to come back and tell us the water is gone."},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"Of course. Even if the Punishing disaster ends one day, we won't live to see it."},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"Haha, maybe you still can. We don't have much time left."},{"T":"301","3":"Lustrous turns around and looks at her colleague."},{"T":"301","3":"He stares back with a calm and prepared look."},{"T":"301","2":"Lustrous","3":"I'm going back to work. Is there anything else you want to say?"},{"T":"301","3":"The medical director gazes at the gloomy sky outside the corridor. There seems to be a little moonlight shining through the far horizon, giving the sky a barely visible silver lining."},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"Ma'am, I am sorry. But I have to say this."},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"Honestly, I am tired of this view. But I still wish I can live to see it one more time."},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"When I watched that kid struggle in the water, I was thinking to myself, that it was a good thing to be alive."},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"To be alive means I can feel sorrow, pain and anger. I can give my best for tomorrow."},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"Rationally, I am already prepared. I know this is the best solution and there is no other choice."},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"But... just like that kid, I don't want to die."},{"T":"301","2":"Medical Director","3":"We aren't devoid of weakness. We were just forced to 'send' it away."},{"T":"301","3":"Lustrous has not talked."},{"T":"301","3":"She stands on the shore and remains silent for a long time. Finally, she lets out a slight sigh that melts in the wind of the Atlantic."}]
