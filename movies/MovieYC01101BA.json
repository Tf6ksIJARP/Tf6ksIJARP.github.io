[{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"YOOOOOO! WHOOOAAAA! This ship is BIG!"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Keep your voice down, Kamui. If some guards are hiding nearby and they hear you\u2014"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"I don't see the point of staying quiet, though!"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"After all, this place is hustlin' and bustlin' already, right?"},{"T":"301","3":"Kamui points at the clamor in front of him."},{"T":"301","3":"The deck of the giant vessel is jam-packed with people, shouting, seething, trampling over each other."},{"T":"301","3":"Shouts peddling wares fill the ship. Curious-looking merchants, like ants, fill every inch of the space."},{"T":"301","2":"Peddling Voices","3":"Dried earthworms! Dried earthworms, dug fresh from the mud in the ballast! Get one for three grubs or one mile!"},{"T":"301","2":"Curses","3":"Hey! Hey! Whatcha think ya doing? Use your eyes, not your hands! That's 200 mileage if you chip my wares!"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Goods... More goods..."},{"T":"301","2":"Merchant B","3":"Anyone need a hand? We've got medical-grade prosthetics straight from the Golden Age. Of the highest quality!"},{"T":"301","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"...Yeah, you're right."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"And you were wondering how to blend in! Looks like we can just march straight through."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Kamui, wait\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"Chrome yanks Kamui back before he can stride into the crowds. With his free hand, he alters the frequency of the Inver-Device in order to receive a sudden message."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Great, great... finally."},{"T":"301","3":"The rushed words were uttered by a blonde youth who soon appears in the line of sight of the two Strike Hawk members, beaming. He looks delicate and friendly."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"This is executive officer Nikola's private channel. Who are you?"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Don't worry, I'm Nikola's agent. He's on another mission, so I'm in charge of getting in touch with our contacts."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Here. My credentials."},{"T":"301","3":"The blonde youth could have sent his electronic ID to Chrome, but for some reason, he pulls out the physical employee ID from inside his suit and holds it close to the screen."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Ooh, a rookie tactician in the Combat Department... and your name is Murray..."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Wait. Murray, huh... I apologize for the impudence, but are you related to Lee from the Gray Raven squad?"},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"Yep, you got it. I'm Brother's brother. Uh, that sounded weird. Anyway, yeah, I'm Lee's younger brother."},{"T":"301","3":"The youth\u2014Murray\u2014smiles and greets the two."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"Anyway, back to the main point. Executive officer Nikola should have already told you about the mission details, but I'll still run it past you again as per official procedure."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"For this mission, the Strike Hawk squad shall investigate the suddenly-appeared KCC vessel to see if there is indeed a Chamber of Commerce presence on the ship, and also search for the subsidiary AI systems of Gestalt."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"The second part is the one we should prioritize, right?"},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"Yeah. It's a direct assignment from Executive officer Nikola. We don't know why this KCC ship showed up all of a sudden, but the movements of other factions is not the primary concern of this mission."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"Word for word from Executive Officer Nikola, 'Our main objective is to find if there are any Gestalt-related AIs on the ship.'"},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"If there aren't, we retreat immediately. If there are..."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"We take them. By force."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"Well, that's what it says on paper. But it might be better to retreat immediately after the inspection. There's only two of you, so combat is gonna be tough."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Um, question!"},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"Sure, if I know the answer."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"I keep hearing about it, but... What exactly is Gestalt?"},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Sorry, our Kamui is a bit\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"With Kamui's untimely question, everyone falls silent. Murray gapes in disbelief."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"Um, no, it's fine. Since you have a question, I'll give you a brief answer. Gestalt is... well, an AI system that can perform super-large-scale calculations."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"This AI will self-develop and learn, and perform all sorts of calculations or research for us according to our needs."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Wow, that's dope. So we can just chuck everything to Gestalt then, huh?"},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"Essentially, yes. Some used to call Gestalt a dream come true. It didn't end up being that amazing, but it still completed its most important mission of..."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"...Protecting humans. In fact, Babylonia is protected by Gestalt."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Like how our Inver-Devices protect Babylonia?"},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"Not exactly, but that also works as an explanation."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"Gestalt is a system that keeps Babylonia running. Kind of like a firewall for Babylonia."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"However, there's more than one AI developed with the same low-level infrastructure as Gestalt. Which means that the defense of Babylonia\u2014"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"\u2014Could be at risk of being broken through if someone else manages to find the source code of Gestalt-related AIs."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"Yes."},{"T":"301","3":"Murray sighs, and Kamui heaves a heavy sigh as well."},{"T":"301","2":"Murray","3":"Either way, we can't allow the wrong people to find the source code. I'll act as support during your operation. Let's set off then, Strike Hawk."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Ooh! Let's go!"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Wait... Capt., what exactly are we gonna do?"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Don't act all excited to set off one second and become confused the next. But, well... I do have some clues. Someone back at the market just caught my eye."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Follow me, Kamui!"}]
