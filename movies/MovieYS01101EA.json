By the way, I've discovered something."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"On the way here, I've explored the information about the memory data many times. Since the records were too far back, there's a severe loss of data."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"From the analysis of limited records, the memory data is not dangerous. But there's something wrong about the records..."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Hmm... Such a good sleep... Well?"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"I feel so light!

Have you betrayed the Moe Army?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"So I guess this is what the missing data and abnormal reaction in the records refer to."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"The original memory data actually exists in such a form...
