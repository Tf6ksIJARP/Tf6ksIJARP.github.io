I told you and your team not to overwork yourselves, remember?"},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Sure... Anyway, remember that I entrusted you with testing the CUBs?"},{"T":"302","2":"I do, but..."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Regarding the project, there has been some... how to say..."},{"T":"302","2":"Sorry, I need to go.
