[{"T":"301","3":"Vera finishes off her enemies with ease. They did pose some threats, but she is used to this kind of chaotic, one-against-many skirmish."},{"T":"301","3":"On the other hand, Lloyd can hardly get up. He looks to be in pain."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Hey, don't tell me you are hurt..."},{"T":"301","3":"Vera does not think the kick could have injured Lloyd as she was holding back. She checks him anyway just to be safe."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"This is... the Punishing Virus infection. Still mild though..."},{"T":"301","3":"Vera finds that Lloyd is equipped with a new model of stealth Inver-Device, so he probably will not turn into a Corrupted from such a mild infection."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Why did you hold that soldier for so long? You know you're going to get infected... Are you seriously not afraid to die, or just dumb?"},{"T":"301","3":"Vera realizes there are still scratches on Lloyd left by the excited infected soldier, some of which are deep enough to reach inside his artificial muscles. They probably have worsened his infection."},{"T":"301","3":"She lets out a sigh and tosses a nano-repair injector near Lloyd. Seeing him struggle to pick it up, she finally loses her patience and deftly gives him the jab herself."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"Thank you... Miss Vera..."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"I'll have to go out of my way to kill you if you turn into a Corrupted. Like I said, I hate to do extra work."},{"T":"301","3":"An old bullet-proof notebook lies open on the ground next to Lloyd. Vera takes a glimpse at the book as she picks it up, and realizes it is full of Lloyd's past deeds."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Did you get yourself trapped in the sand just to pick this up? What is it, a notebook recording all your heroic actions...? That's next-level narcissism."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"Please give it back to me..."},{"T":"301","3":"Vera returns the notebook to Lloyd, whose shaking hands fail to hold it properly. As it drops to the ground again, a few tags fall out, all of which have 'Lloyd' engraved on them."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"What are they? Do you really keep multiple tags of yourself? What a toff..."},{"T":"301","3":"Lloyd's face turns ghastly pale as he anxiously picks the nameplates up. Suddenly, Vera realizes something. She grabs his collar and harshly pulls him close."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Hey, what are you and Nikola hiding from me?"},{"T":"301","3":"The excess tags and the performance that did not match his legends indicate something is not right with this young man before her..."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"'Lloyd'... Who are you exactly...?"},{"T":"301","3":"Vera slams an investigation report on Nikola's desk. He does not seem to care at all, only staring back into Vera's eyes."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Did you complete the mission...?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Stop digressing. Who the heck is Lloyd? And... what is this recall thing?"},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola looks over Vera at Lloyd."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Did you tell her?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"No... but..."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"I did the investigation myself. You will know how I found out later."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Did you, now? You've guessed everything, but you didn't tell the public. That means you don't have solid evidence yet."},{"T":"301","3":"Vera casts a fierce look at Nikola, but he is right. It is all but her own guess."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"I never thought I could hide it from you. Now that you have figured it out, I may as well just tell you everything."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"Commander Nikola..."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"It's okay. She will find out sooner or later. Cerberus should be disbanded if she can't find the truth with what she already knows."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Recall... is just a lie. Am I right?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Correct. Strictly speaking, recalling is impossible. We still do not have the technologies or circumstances to avoid the 'death' of soldiers through recalling."},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola frankly admits the truth. Vera can hardly control her anger as her fist slams hard on Nikola's desk."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Have you ever thought about how many people died without knowing the truth because of this **** lie?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"But it also saved countless soldiers from despair and the fear of death."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"That's bull****... One day, this lie will be exposed."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"No, it won't. So long as Lloyd is still around as the 'undying' hero."},{"T":"301","3":"Vera finally realizes Lloyd's purpose. He is the 'symbol' of recalling and the soldier's 'hope,' covering the underlying lie."},{"T":"301","3":"But if recalling never existed, Lloyd cannot possibly be 'undying.'"},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"As long as 'Lloyd' is still active, his legend will live on... Nobody cares about who he really is."},{"T":"301","3":"Even if Lloyd dies, Babylonia can just make a new 'Lloyd'\u2014all it takes are a similar frame, an actor, and lots of carefully designed propaganda."},{"T":"301","3":"Perhaps... soldiers are only hoping that 'The Undying Loy' is real, and that their fallen comrades and themselves will not face the threat of death."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Lloyd knew about this secret the moment he was activated. Still, he chose to become this 'Lloyd' and continued to lie. Every generation of 'Lloyd' made the same decision."},{"T":"301","3":"Vera looks incredulously at Lloyd. To her, this is no different from giving up all personalities to live in another person's shadow."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Because every 'Lloyd' knows very well that it does not matter whether the recall is a lie or a real redemption. False hope is still hope."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"How self-justified. Aren't you worried that I will expose all your dirty secrets?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"We need 'Lloyd'. So do the countless soldiers out there. And..."},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola makes an extremely aggressive smile and stares at Vera."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"You better not forget that... none of your Cerberus members could get into Babylonia without my help."},{"T":"301","3":"Nikola was confident that he could contain Vera, so he sent her together with Lloyd in their operation to add more credits to Lloyd's legend."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Thank you for being frank... I am but a tool of yours."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"I never get myself into trouble for the sake of so-called justice... but there's something I must warn you about."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"Miss Vera..."},{"T":"301","3":"Vera walks straight to the door, then turns around and gives Lloyd a cold stare. He lowers his head and grasps the notebook."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"A lie is always a lie... If you aren't a hero, you will never be one."}]
