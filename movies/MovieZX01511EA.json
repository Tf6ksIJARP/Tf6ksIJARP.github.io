The roar even echoes through the channel, so Chi Ling simply removes his headset and holds it in his hand."},{"T":"301","2":"Chi Ling","3":"Useless. Oh, well. I know what I have to do."},{"T":"301","3":"Chi Ling crushes his headset, causing electric currents to travel up his hand. He steps forward, knowing that returning to his position would only incur more losses."},{"T":"301","3":"He squats down and charges up with his right hand. He aims at his target, then... Three, two, one\u2014punch!"},{"T":"301","3":"Chi Ling's fist caves in the Corrupted's head in front of him.

Just 10 more meters to go."},{"T":"301","3":"The familiar sound of an explosion comes from behind again. Debris from the Corrupted falls at Chi Ling's feet.

Even adult men have to hold it with both hands to suppress its recoil."},{"T":"301","3":"But now, Chi Ling no longer have to worry about accuracy.
