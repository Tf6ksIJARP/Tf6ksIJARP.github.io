[{"T":"301","3":"Wind speed 30, southeast."},{"T":"301","3":"Your keen senses notice the temperature changes, and your eyes see the vapor trail behind the fast-oncoming, long-range bullet without a scope in the simulated training area. You duck back, and it almost grazes your scalp."},{"T":"301","3":"Your opponent has missed. A flicker of light reflected from the scope on his sniper rifle flashes in the corner of your eye, revealing his location."},{"T":"301","3":"Your magazine is empty. You pull the bolt back and put the bullet into the chamber with instinct. There is a slight heat around where your skin touches the heavy stock. 'Click!' And your gun is loaded."},{"T":"301","3":"You begin searching with all your attention... And you spot the top half of a head in your scope, hidden among covers."},{"T":"301","3":"Now!"},{"T":"301","3":"Without further thinking, you pull the trigger, and the bullet bursts out of the chamber with a bang, with a wisp of light blue smoke coming out of the muzzle."},{"T":"301","2":"System","3":"Contestant A-14, Wanshi, is out. Environment simulation over. Logging out."},{"T":"301","3":"The system notification announces all around the venue. Noisy chatter finds its way in as the sound of the machines running fades away."},{"T":"301","2":"Surprised Male Voice","3":"What an excellent shot. The commandant catches the opponent in an instant..."},{"T":"301","2":"Calm Male Voice","3":"And Wanshi was beating us all without any mercy! Considering that the simulation has already been adjusted to balance the differences between a human and a Construct...","4":"(Take off gears)"},{"T":"301","3":"You remove the device above your eyes at the same time as the Construct across from you. As the chatters around you fade away from the two of you showing up, you both catch each other's eyes in this moment of silence."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Wanshi doesn't often engage in this kind of group exercise. He's more used to training alone."},{"T":"301","3":"Chrome, standing next to you, explains."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"If it weren't for him hogging this training room sleeping, he wouldn't be dragged into training by the commandants!"},{"T":"301","3":"The simulation training room is often occupied by Constructs and commandants on their rest days. The training cabins are set up to balance the performance of Constructs and humans, making it easier to train together."},{"T":"301","3":"Liv has asked you not to overuse your right hand after you sprained it on a mission, so you opted to train here instead, and that was when you bumped into Strike Hawk and some commandants waiting to practice with Wanshi."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"By the way, Commandant, how does it feel to practice with this guy?"},{"T":"302","2":"Pretty good.","4":"He just..."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"You're the only commandant that has defeated Wanshi so far!"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Before you logged in, Wanshi had no idea who he'd be up against. So there was no way he was letting you win on purpose!"},{"T":"302","2":"Are you saying he'd let me win if he knew?","4":"Why do I feel like he..."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"...Ah, Gray Raven Commandant."},{"T":"301","3":"Wanshi suddenly interrupts the conversation as if he has just recognized you, and he nods at you."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Right, you've been on a mission together before, so you should know each other."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"But why are you here at the simulation training room today, Commandant? I've barely seen you here before."},{"T":"302","2":"It's not the best time for me to shoot a real firearm."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Huh, is that so... Please take some rest, Commandant."},{"T":"301","2":"Commandant B","3":"Chrome, should we continue? I didn't even get to use the gun just now! Wanshi found and 'killed' me within seconds."},{"T":"301","2":"Commandant A","3":"You can't even last three minutes against me. Stop making a fool out of yourself."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"All commandants have their strengths, and not all of them are shooters. Besides, this simulation uses conventional snipers instead of the newer tactical pistols you are used to, so your unfamiliarity is only natural."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Hmm... but I bet the Gray Raven Commandant must be a sharpshooter."},{"T":"302","2":"I'm flattered.","4":"Exactly, I'm the top gun of Babylonia!"},{"T":"301","2":"Commandant B","3":"After all, the Gray Raven Commandant is the first person to have ever hit Wanshi, right?"},{"T":"301","2":"Commandant A","3":"...As expected from the Gray Raven Commandant, I guess?"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Wanshi, if you... Kamui, what are you doing there?"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Ah, you mean this? It's a sign I just made."},{"T":"301","3":"Kamui holds up the sign in his hands, which reads, 'Strike Hawk Elite Sniper Holiday Training Partner, 50 Black Cards per session'."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Wanshi, why are you looking so tired? It's your day off!"},{"T":"301","3":"Being the center of attention, Wanshi, however, just looks away and lies back in the training cabin, seemingly ready to fall back asleep again."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Stop sleeping, Wanshi! What are you doing? We're starting a new business here..."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Huh..."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Captain, Wanshi is hogging the training room to sleep again!"},{"T":"301","3":"Seeing this, another commandant in the training room shrugs."},{"T":"301","2":"Commandant A","3":"I haven't had enough practice yet. Gray Raven Commandant, would you like to practice with me?"},{"T":"302","2":"Sure.","4":"Sorry, perhaps next time."},{"T":"301","2":"Commandant A","3":"Great, bring it on!"},{"T":"301","2":"Commandant B","3":"I'm next!"},{"T":"301","2":"Commandant A","3":"Ah... but it's such a rare opportunity to meet the Gray Raven Commandant..."},{"T":"301","2":"Commandant B","3":"The commandant's probably tired, so stop being such a bother. Come practice with me!"},{"T":"301","2":"Commandant A","3":"...I should start with the solo mode!"},{"T":"301","2":"Commandant B","3":"Why are you being weirdly silent? Am I not good enough for you? Get back here!"},{"T":"301","3":"Everyone's attention gradually shifts this way. Amid the noises, it seems like you are the only one who notices that Wanshi has quietly left."}]
