Even though she cannot see it, Alpha knows where the bridge leads."},{"T":"301","3":"She cast away her original name here..."},{"T":"301","3":"...in order to break with the past."},{"T":"301","3":"Luna only gave her a silent nod regarding it when she returned."},{"T":"301","2":"\u03b1","3":"Luna."},{"T":"301","3":"She repeats that name silently to herself and takes in the devastation in the distance."},{"T":"301","2":"\u03b1","3":"...Where are you?"},{"T":"301","3":"It happened on the last day."},{"T":"301","3":"Once the Gray Ravens began their descent into the Polyphage Abyss, Roland shares the truth with her."},{"T":"301","3":"And then\u2014"},{"T":"301","2":"\u03b1","3":"Gabriel..."},{"T":"301","3":"Gabriel steps out of a dark corner, still acting as courteous as ever, but he can hardly conceal the deranged sense of menace he is giving off."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"Well, he's all yours."},{"T":"301","3":"As Roland passes Alpha with a nonchalant smile, he leans over and lowers his voice."},{"T":"301","2":"Roland","3":"I'm going to deal with Gabriel's 'backup.' Only then will Luna be able to leave the core."},{"T":"301","3":"With a quick stroke of his chain blade, he leaps into the darkness of the core."},{"T":"301","3":"By the time Gabriel moves to stop Roland, Alpha has already lunged forward with her blade out."},{"T":"301","2":"\u03b1","3":"You betrayed Luna."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"...Me? No, Miss Luna is the one who betrayed us, and you\u2014you are the reason for her betrayal! You are why she was forsaken by the Ascension-Network! Why she has lost the power of an agent!"},{"T":"301","2":"\u03b1","3":"Luna... has never betrayed anyone of us!"},{"T":"301","3":"Alpha's blade slices across Gabriel's chest, sending sparks flying everywhere.

Gabriel is forced back, barely managing to counter her every move with his cane."},{"T":"301","3":"Although he is unaware that she was seriously injured in her M.I.N.D., Gabriel still notices that her strikes are weaker than before."},{"T":"301","3":"Seeing a rare opening, he gives it everything he has got, abandoning defense for offense."},{"T":"301","2":"\u03b1","3":"...Perfect!"},{"T":"301","3":"Once one of the combatants gives up on defense, the battle will soon be over."},{"T":"301","3":"Gabriel has staked everything on this battle in order to achieve the lofty goal given to him by the Ascension-Network."},{"T":"301","3":"However, as the battle goes on, Alpha's M.I.N.D. also gradually starts to stabilize."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"No point dragging this out any longer, take this! Your body will provide sustenance for the Polyphage!"},{"T":"301","3":"Sensing that something is amiss, Gabriel immediately leaps high into the air and delivers an armor-pulverizing blow in Alpha's direction."},{"T":"301","3":"But when the dust settles, the only person on the cracked ground is Gabriel."},{"T":"301","3":"He is completely unable to hit the fleet-footed Alpha. His immense strength, of which he has been so proud of, is useless if he cannot land a hit."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Alpha\u2014!"},{"T":"301","3":"Gabriel's attack has left him completely open to Alpha's space-tearing strike."},{"T":"301","3":"And with that, the battle is concluded."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"...Hah... I cannot fault Miss Luna for relying on you."},{"T":"301","3":"Gabriel crawls among the ruins, dragging his broken body.

Her katana bounces violently against an unseen wall."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Alpha."},{"T":"301","3":"An irreverent call comes from behind her and with it, walls start to appear around them, getting thicker and thicker.

I'm an agent."},{"T":"301","2":"\u03b1","3":"So, you are... Vonnegut."},{"T":"301","3":"Alpha sheathes her katana, calmly appraising the black figure before her."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"Looks like you've heard of me."},{"T":"301","2":"\u03b1","3":"Of course. If it wasn't for your Ascendant underling, that incident wouldn't have happened."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"I only had him bring about what the humans had been hoping for all along. That commandant\u2014Ravenge, I believe?

I'm simply running an experiment to increase the efficiency of the filtering process."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"Back then in Babylonia, you were furious that your comrades had to be sacrificed, but now that you've become an Ascendant, are you really planning to oppose the filtering?"},{"T":"301","2":"\u03b1","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"That's what I thought."},{"T":"301","2":"\u03b1","3":"Why are you here?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"For the 'glad tidings,' of course."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"The Punishing Virus has exhibited the ability to become organic and these new lifeforms are truly the peak of perfection!"},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"This planet is undergoing a rebirth and as an agent, I, of course, would like to bear witness to it."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"...!"},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"You're the one who hatched the Polyphage in the Red Tide, aren't you?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"You saved the reborn Punishing Virus and opened up new possibilities to Ascnet. Good job."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"You... approve of this?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"Of course."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"This is a step in the evolution of Ascnet."},{"T":"301","3":"Vonnegut's eyes are riveted on the gushing Red Tide below with appreciation."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"Unfortunately, I came a little too late and Luna's destroyed the Polyphage. The Babylonians have also arrived and will soon clear out this area."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"As much as I'd love to prevent this catastrophe, as long as we're unable to make a move on Babylonia, that thorn in our side, wiping out individual Babylonians won't make a difference."},{"T":"301","3":"He shifts his gaze from the Red Tide to Gabriel, who lies behind him, struggling to crawl out from under the boulder, his hand reaching out."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"Don't worry, as long as the breeder's knowledge remains, there's still hope."},{"T":"301","3":"He claps his hands and the boulder pressing down on Gabriel is blown to smithereens."},{"T":"301","2":"\u03b1","3":"Vonnegut!"},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"Alpha, I'll undo the force field between you, but I have something to tell you before that."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"Luna's been rescued from the Polyphage and is highly likely to have been taken by the Babylonians."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"You know what this means, don't you?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"Can you bear the thought of her having to go through what you went through?"},{"T":"301","3":"He smiles and with a snap of his fingers, the force field in Alpha's way dissipated. She tightens her grip on her weapon, glaring at the person standing between her and Gabriel's broken body."},{"T":"301","3":"But ultimately, she chooses to hurry toward the Abyss, where the Polyphage was."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"Get up, breeder."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"I know you're loyal to Ascnet. You yearn for greater power to augment your body."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"So I'll bestow upon you new life and a power that is befitting of the name Gabriel."},{"T":"301","2":"Vonnegut","3":"In exchange..."},{"T":"301","3":"Ignoring the two of them, Alpha hurriedly rushes toward the Polyphage."},{"T":"301","3":"But all that remains there is the Babylonian reinforcement. Whether to battle them or continue searching, she still cannot find Luna."},{"T":"301","3":"Have the humans gotten her?"},{"T":"301","3":"A feeling of unease spreads through Alpha, but it is precisely because of this that she has to search for Luna."},{"T":"301","3":"Because she is family, her only family."}]
