I never expected to see a person from Eden with my own eyes."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"So... Care for something to eat?"},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"The outside is worn down and rusty, but it's safe to eat as long as the can doesn't bulge or leak."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"This is the last batch of cans produced before the Great Evacuation. These things can be preserved longer than you'd think."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"Even if it's only leftover soup from the past civilization."},{"T":"302","2":"No, but thanks."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"Very well. I'm sure it's a bit preposterous for people who live in the clouds to eat gruel such as this."},{"T":"302","2":"It's not that. Aren't you on short supplies?","4":"It's too precious for us to eat it."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"You're showing us sympathy? That sure is surprising..."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"It's nothing special. Some people used to go catch fish in the sea."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"But recently, those red creatures\u2014the 'Hetero-Creatures' you mentioned\u2014have thrown everyone into a panic.

Sometimes you just have to stand up for what you believe in."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"And what is that exactly?

Perhaps, some people just simply didn't want to leave."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"Yes, some people were unfortunately unable to board Eden."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"While others remained because their loved ones didn't get a ticket onto Eden."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"Some people stayed because they didn't want to abandon their homeland."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"Regardless of the reason, we chose to stay, and we accepted our fate."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"After making this choice, we planted our roots here and continued to fight."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"But this place isn't suitable for humanity."},{"T":"301","3":"This is indeed the case. Even though the wasteland is far from nearby cities and so the Corrupted poses little threat, the cruelty of nature provides no safe harbor."},{"T":"301","3":"The old man nods in agreement."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"Look at the land around you\u2014this dry and ugly land."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"We originally lived in the city. We decided on this place and built our home here\u2014albeit after great difficulty."},{"T":"302","2":"Why did you choose this place?"},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"Because nature is terrifying. Once civilization collapsed, nature reclaimed every corner of urban life."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"Without water, electricity or natural gas, skyscrapers became nothing but steel cages."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"Everyone died without dignity\u2014like animals. At first, we had the capacity to cremate or bury the bodies. But soon, those left alive could bear it no more."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"The city was silent. Corpses continued to pile up. You can't imagine the despair\u2014the sight and smell of people you once knew decaying in the city you once loved."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"Many people died from the Punishing Virus, and many died to infectious diseases. In order to survive and avoid the Corrupted, we left the city and ended up here."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"Not too close, but not too far. Here in this wasteland, we watch over humanity's former glory."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"Who would've thought that a group of 'mice' such as ourselves would still live here to this very day."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"Save your solemn expression."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"At first, we thought we wouldn't even last a year. But actually, it wasn't as bad as we thought."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"Thankfully, we had relics of civilization."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"You see, glass, metal, plastic... Even solar panels can be recycled. Although the semiconductor film is almost worn out, we can still rely on it to produce some electricity. At least it's enough to keep a few lights on at night."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"These items may seem like worthless garbage to you, but they are treasures to us."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"Just like this land."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"My wife and I built our house on this land with our own hands. It may be falling apart and always leaking, but it's my home."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"We may have lingered on our last breaths, but we kept each other going. The ten years I spent with her were a short happy time in my unfortunate life."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"When she passed away, I buried her on a distant hill overlooking the sea."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"Most of my generation that chose to stay during the Great Evacuation has turned to dust beneath the wheel of history. Now, there are only a few dozen of us left."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"But the descendants of those who died have now grown up and started to raise their own children."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"When it came time to bury my old friends, I buried them on the same hill overlooking the sea."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"Standing here, we can look back on the glory of the past and see the tombstones of our old friends."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"If we were to leave, then we would truly have nothing."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"Everything we cherish, believe, remember, and love will be completely shattered."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"Besides, even if you hadn't shown up, we wouldn't have lasted much longer."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"We scavenge all of our serum from the nearby city. That's bound to run out sooner or later."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"Everyone knows this, so we are ready to die at any time. Your arrival only means that we will meet our fate sooner."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"People born here were never optimistic to begin with."},{"T":"301","2":"Old Man","3":"Hopeless and destitute.
