Having second thoughts as her creator?"},{"T":"301","2":"Yarha","3":"No, I'm just amazed. I didn't expect Vera and No. 21 to be so compatible... Seems like No. 21 is acting more like a human after spending time with Vera."},{"T":"301","2":"Kurono Leader","3":"Human... Bahaha! She'll never be human again! Constructs are just weapons."},{"T":"301","3":"Yarha resists the urge to argue with his superior.

I found your parents!"},{"T":"301","2":"No. 21","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"No. 21 doesn't react at first.

You don't know about that either?"},{"T":"301","2":"No. 21","3":"Do I need to?"},{"T":"301","2":"No. 20","3":"Your parents gave you life.

If you knew each other..."},{"T":"301","2":"No. 21","3":"Who gave me life?"},{"T":"301","2":"No. 20","3":"Well, I accidentally saw them on your data report... I mean, I wanted to see who my parents were, but I didn't see anything... But I saw yours. Your parents are researchers in the institute."},{"T":"301","2":"No. 21","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"No. 20","3":"Why aren't you happy? I thought you'd be excited. I've been dreaming of finding out who and where my parents are..."},{"T":"301","2":"No. 20","3":"How about you try to meet them?

Why..."},{"T":"301","2":"No. 21","3":"...It's not my concern."},{"T":"301","2":"No. 20","3":"Don't you wanna at least try? They're your parents. Don't you have anything to say?

Don't you care about your only families in this world?"},{"T":"301","3":"No. 21 puts a hand to her chest. She feels her heart begin to race, but she still remains emotionless. No. 20 talks of 'family' and 'love,' but she doesn't understand the meaning behind these words. She doesn't want to do anything the researchers wouldn't allow."},{"T":"301","3":"The researchers who force her to wear this collar and conduct countless painful experiments... The people who gave her life are among them."},{"T":"301","3":"If so, then she was only given life so she could be born as a test subject. The thought of this leaves her with no amount of optimism."},{"T":"301","2":"No. 21","3":"I... have no family. I don't care."},{"T":"301","2":"No. 20","3":"You really are..."},{"T":"301","3":"No. 20 bites her lip firmly, her cheeks trembling with anger. No. 21 cannot possibly imagine how she feels."},{"T":"301","2":"No. 20","3":"I'm so jealous of you! Your results are always top of the charts, even with how sick you are.

Time to pay a visit."},{"T":"301","3":"No. 21 and Vera enter the cave and follow the dark corridor."},{"T":"301","3":"The corridor is strewn with broken limbs, and the ground is covered in a grimy liquid. They can't tell if it's blood or vital fluid."},{"T":"301","2":"No. 21","3":"Did you... do this?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Sure did. I butchered the entire institute. Got a problem with that?"},{"T":"301","3":"Vera hisses a laugh in the darkness."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Look around. All of these are the remains of failed Constructs. Those Daedalus bastards couldn't even modify a single Construct."},{"T":"301","2":"No. 21","3":"...Not even one?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Each failed attempt was placed in embalming fluid and stored here in the laboratory like specimens."},{"T":"301","3":"A chill crawls up No. 21's spine."},{"T":"301","3":"Even... No. 20...?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"These idiots are still looking for answers among complete failures... How pitiful."},{"T":"301","3":"Vera turns on her flashlight, and the cold, chilling light illuminates her face.

Let sleeping dogs lie..."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"It's just a mass grave."},{"T":"301","3":"At the end of the corridor, Vera turns left. Standing there, No. 21 turns around to look down the corridor."},{"T":"301","3":"How had she crawled all this way on instinct alone? This cold, rotten corridor is like a tongue sticking out of hell. It's sticky and moist, as if trying to devour all that enter."},{"T":"301","3":"A cold chill washes over No. 21. Standing in this place after living here for so many years... Only Vera's red frame offers any semblance of warmth."},{"T":"301","3":"No. 21 quickens her pace to catch up with Vera."},{"T":"301","3":"The door to the archive opens, and No. 21 steps in.

Vera turns off her flashlight and leads the way."},{"T":"301","3":"A dim light shines in the dark recesses of the room. There's a rustling sound, like a mouse nibbling on a page."},{"T":"301","3":"As they approach, No. 21 hears a human mumbling."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Where is it... Where is it..."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Where... the hell... is it..."},{"T":"301","3":"Vera takes out her blade and clenches it tightly. She flicks her eyes, gesturing No. 21 to go around the right side."},{"T":"301","3":"In the faint blue light of a flashlight, they see a man wearing a lab coat hovering over a drawer of files, searching for something. Stacks of documents and numerous empty cans are scattered on the ground beside him."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"...Not here either..."},{"T":"301","3":"A moment later, a light flashes in the man's thick glasses and a blade appears at his throat."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Nghahhh!!"},{"T":"301","3":"The frightened man suddenly collapses on the ground. Right then, the lights to the archive turn on, revealing a disheveled man with glasses and a scratchy beard.

How'd you manage to survive here so long?"},{"T":"301","3":"The man tries to block the light on his face with his hands. He breaths rapidly, and the corners of his mouth tremble as if under duress.

Lunatic."},{"T":"301","3":"No. 21, who turned on the lights, walks back over to Vera and looks at the man's worrisome face."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Do you know him, No. 21?"},{"T":"301","2":"No. 21","3":"No, I've never seen him."},{"T":"301","3":"Hearing the name 'No. 21', the man suddenly looks up at her in disbelief.

You're No. 21?"},{"T":"301","2":"Daedalus Researcher?","3":"My dear, my sweet dear\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"The man stretches out his dirty hands to hold No. 21's leg, but the Co-Bot and Vera's blade stand in his way."},{"T":"301","3":"No. 21 steps back.

I'm your father!"},{"T":"301","2":"No. 21","3":"...Father?"},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"Sorry?"},{"T":"301","3":"Vera raises her eyebrows and looks at No. 21, speechless."},{"T":"301","2":"Vera","3":"This lunatic is your pops?"},{"T":"301","2":"No. 21","3":"I don't know... I..."},{"T":"301","3":"No. 21's mood becomes chaotic again. Strange feelings collide in her chest. She feels a lack of oxygen again.

Don't kill me\u2014please!"},{"T":"301","2":"No. 21","3":"Gone? Did she die?"},{"T":"301","3":"No. 21 repeats indifferently.

Here's my proof..."},{"T":"301","2":"No. 21","3":"I don't need it."},{"T":"301","3":"No. 21 says blankly. She breathes hard, trying to stifle an inexplicable feeling clogged in her chest.
