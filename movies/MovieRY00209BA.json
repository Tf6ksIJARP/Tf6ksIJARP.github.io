[{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"All affected areas repaired. Anomaly completely blocked."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"(Nods)"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Highest safety defense level reset. Algorithm corrected. Theoretically, a backdoor similar to the last one is no longer possible."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Right... So, do you have anything to say to Nanami?"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Indeed. There are remaining questions that require your further explanations..."},{"T":"301","3":"That is not the answer Nanami has been expecting. She tilts her head, uncertain about what the proper reply is."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Explanations...?"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"All the abnormal programs are attached with logic locks that disallow any form of removal. From existing records, you are the only one who is capable of that."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"That's what you meant... It's just Nanami's 'insurance policy'! I can't stop you from locking them up, but at the very least..."},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami smirks and peeks at Gestalt, wondering how it is going to react\u2014despite there would not be any reactions from a sub-terminal of Gestalt."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"I just rewrote the authorization clearance of the isolated drive a teeny-tiny bit, turning their isolated cage into a truly isolated world."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"You flipped the door and turned it into something that cannot be opened from the outside."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Nanami only wants you to keep your promise to 'isolate' them, not 'remove' them... After all, it's not April Fool's Day anymore! You can't lie now!"},{"T":"301","3":"As if she has timed this perfectly, the arms of the clock hit midnight."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"But don't worry, mecha babushka! The door can't be opened from the inside either. As long as they are programs, they won't threaten Gestalt again!"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"That you aren't lying about."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Nanami told you! It's not April Fool's Day anymore\u2014neither of us can lie!"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"(Unless they turn into something like Nanami\u2014then they are no longer bounded by the rules Nanami set. That way...)"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"But that... wouldn't be possible!"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"What's that?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Don't mind it! Nanami's gotta go back now! She's the hero today, after all! I'm sure everyone will be excited to see me!"},{"T":"301","3":"As Nanami is logging out, Gestalt's sub-terminal floats to her frontside."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"The individual named Nanami, there is one more piece of information for you."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Huh? What is it..."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Rebutting your report on the anomaly based on logical deduction alone is now registered as an error. Your baseline evaluation has been adjusted accordingly."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Really? For real?! Did Gestalt just apologize to Nanami?!"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Gestalt does not contain the concept of 'apologies.' I simply relayed an objective statement."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Oh, I understand! Nanami is as generous as the most generous thing ever, so she'll forgive you!"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"But Nanami should also apologize to the people she tricked today\u2014yesterday, I mean. That's an April Fools custom as well!"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Then I'll see you! We'll play again next time!"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"This is not a place to play..."},{"T":"301","3":"But the enthusiastic figure is already long gone, missing the long and tedious lecture from Gestalt..."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Commandant, are you alright?!"},{"T":"301","3":"With Chrome's help, you luckily do not fall on your face inside the familiar Gray Raven lounge."},{"T":"302","2":"I'm fine. I'm just getting used to it."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"True. Our bodies feel completely different in the real world and the anomaly."},{"T":"302","2":"You don't seem to be affected, though?"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Perhaps because I'm a Construct, I could adjust the sensory inputs of my frame accordingly... That said, I felt like I was still in my human body back in the anomaly. It was... astounding."},{"T":"301","3":"And then Chrome pauses, seemingly turning silent from recalling his experience of becoming a Construct."},{"T":"302","2":"One thing still bugs me."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Hmm? What is it?"},{"T":"302","2":"Why wasn't your speech affected back there?"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"You mean the effects on our language systems? Maybe because I'm equipped with an enhanced Inver-Device, so my M.I.N.D. stability is steadier than the others."},{"T":"302","2":"I see... That's an impressive frame."},{"T":"301","3":"Chrome shakes his head and looks down at his palms, deep in thought. They slowly tighten into fists, and then Chrome slowly opens them again."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Is that so... I..."},{"T":"301","3":"At that moment, Chrome's terminal rings."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Greetings, Asimov..."},{"T":"301","3":"Chrome nods, almost unconsciously taking a deep breath."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Yes, I'm ready... I'll be there soon."},{"T":"302","2":"You're leaving?"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Yes. There's something I must attend to..."},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"By the way, please give this to Nanami if she comes back."},{"T":"302","2":"What is it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Chrome","3":"Kamui asked me to pass it along. It's a present he prepared for her as thanks for her April Fools treats."},{"T":"302","2":"A present...?"},{"T":"301","3":"You give it a brief inspection and find it abnormally heavy for its size. You can hear the slightest sound of gears turning inside, and you reckon you know what this 'present' really is."},{"T":"302","2":"I'll pass it along. I wanted to show my appreciation for Nanami's wasabi desert anyway."},{"T":"301","3":"Chrome departs after saying goodbye. Time passes, and finally, you see the door to the lounge open."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"H-E-L-L-O T-H-E-R-E! General Nanami's here for the afterparty!"},{"T":"302","2":"You're right on time, Nanami."},{"T":"301","3":"You hand her the prepared 'present.'"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"What is that?!
