[{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"H-E-L-L-O, Gray Ravens! Here comes Nanami!"},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami barges into the Gray Raven lounge with grandeur before realizing that only Liv is there."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Hmm? Liv, are you the only one here? Where are the others?"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Nanami? Is something wrong? I'm sorry, but everyone is quite busy currently..."},{"T":"301","3":"Seeing how hectic Liv is organizing the files, it really does seem like a busy time to Nanami."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Do you need any help, Liv? Nanami is super duper strong!"},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"I appreciate the thought, but I can... I can handle it..."},{"T":"301","3":"Liv smiles and carries a huge pile of parts and documents, her legs trembling from the weight."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"Everyone on the team has different businesses to take care of today. Commandant's two hours from the end of a meeting, however. You can sit here and wait if you don't mind, but I have to go now."},{"T":"301","3":"Liv leaves while carefully holding on to all the random things she is carrying, leaving Nanami by herself in the lounge."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Who knows how long I have to wait until they're back? Nanami's so bored..."},{"T":"301","3":"Dispirited, Nanami checks out Gray Raven's schedule in the lounge, which lists out all of the Gray Ravens' work arrangements today, updating in real-time."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"So the Gray Ravens are all out helping the different departments... No wonder Liv was carrying all those stuff in such a hurry..."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"How about Commandant? Hmm, a strategy meeting with Chrome from Strike Hawk... for two hours?! That'll take forever..."},{"T":"301","3":"Losing interest, Nanami stares at the screen, suddenly finding a report that has her curious."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Oh? Didn't Lee mention a bug in Gestalt in a recent report? Though the Engineering Force is just treating it as a random data disorder after their inspections..."},{"T":"301","3":"For some reason, Nanami has a hunch that this is no ordinary bug, and so she checks out the details in the report."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Inside the code of this bug report... is a secretly hidden backdoor program! What is going on? Let Nanami give it a crack..."},{"T":"301","3":"She connects with Gestalt to find that despite the strings on the bug being fixed, the secret backdoor from within the system has remained."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"It's crude, but it's good enough to hide from a routine inspection..."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"If Nanami fixes this bug, mecha babushka has to be satisfied with her, right?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Then it's decided! And it's definitely not because Nanami's bored and wants to sneak in and play!"},{"T":"301","3":"Having convinced herself, Nanami finds a comfortable spot to lie down and swings her hands around with odd gestures."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Go\u2014go\u2014Nanami!"},{"T":"301","3":"As her cognitive senses dissociate from reality, Nanami's vision is slowly wrapped in fuzzy white noise\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"By the time the white noise fades away, Nanami finds herself in Babylonia. But despite looking the same, the occasional data flows in the air indicates that the place she is in right now is the virtual space."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Hmm, so I did manage to get in. That fake clearance level is splendidly made for sure! Seems like it's not a naturally formed backdoor... someone left it behind on purpose."},{"T":"301","3":"She puts on a straight face and plays investigator, snooping around for a while, but she fails to discover anything special beyond some standard repair programs."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Maybe it comes from somewhere deeper than here..."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Hello there, Mr. Program! Let Nanami take a look at your repair log, won't you?"},{"T":"301","3":"The program obviously cannot answer her. It just accepts her request and pulls out the logs that are accessible to Nanami's clearance level."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"MZ105423 repaired... MZ105424A repaired... MZ105424B repaired... Repaired, repaired, repaired... It appears that everything is on the up and up."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Hmm...? One of the areas was skipped from inspection! Could it be where it's hiding?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Nanami is getting closer and closer to the truth! Let's go!"},{"T":"301","3":"She tosses the repair program back to its companions, and before they can issue a disruption warning, Nanami is already long gone."},{"T":"301","3":"After the disruption is gone, the repair programs return to their routine as if nothing has happened\u2014they are preprogrammed codes only, after all."},{"T":"301","3":"With the screech of wheels braking, the speeding Nanami comes to a sudden stop at the target location."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Agent Nanami, reporting! Destination arrived! But... which direction should I go next?"},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami stands on tiptoes to look around, but she cannot find anything out of place."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"It surely isn't easy. Nanami must have missed some clues along the way... Hey! What is that?"},{"T":"301","3":"A bunny-shaped program stands out from the rest of the repair programs. It walks past Nanami, muttering, and after the two look at each other in the eyes for a second, the bunny suddenly dashes away."},{"T":"301","2":"'Bunny'","3":"Oh dear<//TICK-TOCK>! Oh dear<//TICK-TOCK>! I shall be too late<//TICK-TOCK>!"},{"T":"301","3":"Stupefied, Nanami freezes for a moment before finally reacting to the bunny, which might be related to the bug that has left the backdoor behind in Gestalt."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"Hey, bugged bunny! Stop running! Stay where you are!"},{"T":"301","3":"Noticing that Nanami is chasing it from behind, the bugged bunny runs even faster before disappearing at a concealed corner."},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami does not even pause to think when she goes after it, and by the time she notices the strange barrier before her, she has already stepped through and entered a hidden dimension..."}]
