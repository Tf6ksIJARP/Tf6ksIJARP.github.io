On the coastline, the destroyed ports and beyond show signs of damage, but the settlements are largely intact."},{"T":"301","2":"Celica","3":"Prior to that, we experienced a wide range of data interference and jamming around New Murmansk."},{"T":"301","2":"Celica","3":"The jamming method was very similar to what we experienced at Venus Splash Park. We speculated that it was the work of an Ascendant, which was later confirmed by Team Ouroboros."},{"T":"301","2":"Celica","3":"Soon after that, the Forest Guard in New Sophiasburgh and the Forsaken stationed nearby began to mobilize towards New Murmansk."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"But subsequent surveillance records from Team Scarab and Team Caribou showed that both the Forest Guard and the Forsaken were impeded about 30 kilometers outside of New Murmansk."},{"T":"301","2":"Celica","3":"...Correct.

I know the data might seem ludicrous, but please believe the first-hand reports from our Support Force."},{"T":"301","2":"Celica","3":"The old Nefheim Institute sustained heavy damage, so almost all reports overestimated the casualty counts.

Otherwise, at least half of the people in New Murmansk would have died."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Whether it was a demonstration of strength or simply because there were hints of humanity within them\u2014I couldn't care less."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"What I care about the most is how will we view this threat?"},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Tifa, Metropolis, New Murmansk... After what happened in Metropolis, it is highly likely that they have control over Huaxu."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"President, they aren't just a few dozen disorganized soldiers using rusty rifles and lies to catch us off guard."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"They've already become a highly organized threat with targeted hostility towards Babylonia."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Therefore, my suggestion as a consultant is to fully disclose information on the Ascendants, and mobilize all of Babylonia\u2014not just the Task Force\u2014to deal with them."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"I agree."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"I've always advocated taking the initiative with a full-scale attack."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Enlist everyone into combat roles, and push the Ascendants into our firing range through saturation attacks..."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"You're calling for the complete military mobilization of Babylonia."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"I cannot agree to this."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Hmph, and that's one of the reasons why we haven't made any progress, isn't it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Hassen, I mean it this time. Now is the time to decide."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"If there were nothing worth saving on the surface when we finally decide to launch a full-scale attack, it would be too late."},{"T":"301","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"An awkward and perilous silence hung over the conference room."},{"T":"301","3":"Celica looked at Asimov, who shrugged helplessly."},{"T":"301","3":"Everyone present could do nothing but look at Hassen and Nikola expectantly."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"Right at that moment, the unceasing buzzing of the alarm disrupted their confrontation."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"What's going on?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Logistics Construct","3":"It's an emergency!

Karenina, how sure are you?"},{"T":"301","2":"Karenina","3":"About sixty percent. Regardless, there isn't an issue with the hardware."},{"T":"301","3":"At this time, Hassen's portal terminal suddenly rang.

Well, this is not what I was expecting, so pardon me while I try to figure out how to phrase it..."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Alright, well..."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"As you can see, the ship is at 10% power, and reports show four groups of gravity engines being taken over and locked in to propel in the opposite direction at maximum capacity, causing our rapid descent."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"While we speak, Babylonia is plummeting towards the ground at an increasing speed."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"The cause of this crisis is unknown.

So consider the following an order\u2014"},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"To identify and solve this problem, I need you to carry out an emergency operation."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"We will use the tactical environment simulation interface, Spear of F.O.S., from the Military Academy as assistance."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"As a tactical environment simulation system, it will translate the data in front of you into comprehensible intel and provide tactical evaluations and suggestions."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"If the situation allows you to connect directly with Babylonia, it can also provide additional functions... But that depends on what happens on the scene."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"However, you will only need to use the graphical interface inside Gestalt for now. We'll talk about the rest later."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"The way this works, Gray Raven, is that you will 'infiltrate' Gestalt."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"In short, I will export your M.I.N.D.s and your commandant's consciousness as virtual programs and upload them into the Gestalt, where you will uncover the issue and resolve it."},{"T":"302","2":"Care to explain?","4":"This order seems like an act of desperation!","6":"Alright, understood."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Of course, a veteran of your caliber can easily understand the situation at hand when I have yet to grasp what is happening."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Huh? Do I really need to explain further... Good grief."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Long story short, Babylonia lacks power and is currently falling out of orbit, as you know."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"The fundamental cause is Gestalt blocking ignition commands to the engines."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Now, for some reason, Gestalt has activated strict anti-interference protocols, which are blocking access from all programs."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"So I came up with an idea, using your M.I.N.D.s as access channels while using the military exercise version of Spear of F.O.S., a command assistant program, as your graphical interface."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Clear so far? I'll load the Constructs' M.I.N.D.s into the virtual space in the form of a 'virtual program,' then I'll install authorization on your commandant's terminal."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"If you can't wrap your head around it, think of yourselves as characters in a video game, and the commandant is the one on the controller."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Then you infiltrate Gestalt, find out why it triggered the lockdown, and resolve the issue. That's it."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"This is the only solution I can think of for our current debacle. We have no other choice."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"I will continue to monitor your status and help you locate the vulnerability in Gestalt in real-time. But, enough talking... You'll learn more once you are in the immersion process."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"I'll ask one more time. Do you remember everything I just said?"},{"T":"302","2":"...Yes."},{"T":"301","3":"With that, Asimov pushes you into the immersion frame behind you."},{"T":"301","3":"As the door closes, the ear-piercing alarm, the cries from the residents...
