[{"T":"301","3":"The group finally arrives at the spacious hall. Located at the end of the 'core,' the terminal blinks in blue; a flashing cord showing that the terminal is in operation stretches up to the ceiling. Nanami seems to have seen this scene before, except it's nothing like what she saw."},{"T":"301","3":"Standing before them is an entire army's worth of 'Gear' machines\u2014against the three of them."},{"T":"301","3":"The red mechanoid girl is standing at the very front of 'Gear', staring at Nanami as she walks toward her."},{"T":"301","3":"Her eyes are still filled with zealous love and confusion. Like a child holding a balloon left in the center of the road, she is still holding the diamond that Nanami did not take."},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami, however, casts not even a glance at the diamond. Taking it that Sage doesn't like the diamond, Zero throws it down the stairs unceremoniously. The diamond rolls down the stairs, eventually landing in a dusty wreckage of mechanoid debris."},{"T":"301","3":"The diamond clinks against the stairs as it rolls down, pounding on Nanami's heart."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Zero","3":"Sage... Sage..."},{"T":"301","3":"The girl desperately runs toward Nanami and holds her hands."},{"T":"301","2":"Zero","3":"Why are you showing such an expression? Did we do anything that upset you? Is our tribute of 'love' not precious enough to suit your revelation?"},{"T":"301","2":"Zero","3":"Is that... why you are leaving us? Is that so? Is that right?"},{"T":"301","2":"Zero","3":"If... we did anything wrong, please, just tell us. We will change it. We will prepare it all over again. Look, we have great efficiency.

What am I supposed to be?"},{"T":"301","2":"Zero","3":"You said I was your 'friend'!"},{"T":"301","2":"Zero","3":"I cannot simulate a world without you. If you are not around... I will... feel..."},{"T":"301","3":"Her lips are open, eyes trembling. She cannot find any words to describe the boiling emotion in her chest. Is it a program error, or the real love instead?"},{"T":"301","3":"Her grip tightens. The sound of breaking metal comes from her hand."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"I need to go, Zero."},{"T":"301","3":"Nanami remains untouched.

Sparks rain down the robot's chainsaw as it begins grinding."},{"T":"301","3":"Her eyes glowing with rage, Nanami hops into Power and charges up to the Wheel of Fortune."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"I might not be able to change this future..."},{"T":"301","2":"Nanami","3":"I'll never allow anyone to hurt my friends!"}]
