Why is so much of the cargo missing this time!"},{"T":"301","2":"Yakov","3":"They said that the snow chains on the truck broke and it overturned in Ladoga Lake... Pff, do they think we'll buy that?"},{"T":"301","2":"Ivan","3":"Yuri and those bastards had to have embezzled it... The ARU keeps sending less supplies with each shipment!"},{"T":"301","2":"Inventory Manager","3":"No way... You expect us to survive the winter with this?"},{"T":"301","2":"Yakov","3":"Hey, Evgeny, you're the head of our district. Say something! If we go on like this, we'll all be finished before the Punishing Virus is eradicated!"},{"T":"301","3":"More and more people gathered around in front of the supply crate as the first few men fought angrily."},{"T":"301","3":"Daddy was surrounded by the crowd. His eyebrows were knit fiercely in an imposing look never before seen since the Punishing Virus had brought everyone to the settlement."},{"T":"301","2":"Evgeny","3":"I know... I'll talk to the person in charge of other settlements. Don't worry, we won't have less supplies."},{"T":"301","2":"Yakov","3":"...Talk? Do you still want to 'talk' with them at this point?"},{"T":"301","3":"The man burst out laughing, and suddenly grabbed Dad by the collar."},{"T":"301","2":"Amberia","3":"Daddy...!"},{"T":"301","3":"Daddy stretched out his hand to keep me behind him as he gently shook his head."},{"T":"301","2":"Evgeny","3":"What are you guys gonna do?"},{"T":"301","2":"Yakov","3":"If they rob us of our supplies without saying a word, we'll rob them back! Why do we have to suffer from starvation and then frigid cold while they leisurely spend the winter with our supplies?!"},{"T":"301","2":"Yakov","3":"We've got enough weapons here in the steel mill. We can make our move tomorrow. Evgeny, you're our leader. We'll follow you."},{"T":"301","2":"Evgeny","3":"But..."},{"T":"301","3":"Yakov grinned a twisted smile and threw the checklist at Daddy."},{"T":"301","2":"Yakov","3":"We've got enough supplies to last us a month. You're the leader, you should have our best interests at heart."},{"T":"301","2":"Yakov","3":"If we don't strike first, then they'll be sure to kill us sooner or later. Just look at this. It's flat out highway robbery!"},{"T":"301","2":"Yakov","3":"You guys agree, don'tcha? This is for the good of the people!"},{"T":"301","3":"Evgeny looked around at the residents. Mothers held their children; old people shook their heads and sighed. Their thin faces were full of callous despair."},{"T":"301","2":"Evgeny","3":"...I understand."},{"T":"301","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"After the crowd dispersed, Daddy turned to look at me. Exhausted, he laughed."},{"T":"301","2":"Evgeny","3":"It's okay. Everything will be all right. Daddy is in charge here. It's my responsibility to ensure everyone gets through this winter safely. Even if... I have to do something I know I shouldn't."},{"T":"301","3":"Daddy looked at me, but I knew he was just talking to himself."},{"T":"301","2":"Evgeny","3":"Lia, wait at home for Daddy to come back. There's nothing to be afraid of."},{"T":"301","3":"The area was engulfed in flames."},{"T":"301","3":"A few days ago, Daddy left with others carrying weapons to visit another settlement. But we haven't heard back from them."},{"T":"301","3":"Then a group of armed thugs blew open the gate to the settlement. They frantically looted the place of its supplies, beat those in their way, and burned the houses."},{"T":"301","3":"I hid in the corner of the room and watched the spreading fire approach from the window. Despite lacking fuel, the frigid house was now hotter than ever."},{"T":"301","2":"Amberia","3":"Cough... There's... Nowhere to go... Daddy, why haven't you come back?"},{"T":"301","3":"Suddenly, someone burst through the door. Covered in injuries, Daddy rushed into the room."},{"T":"301","2":"Amberia","3":"Daddy! Where'd you go? You're hurt...!"},{"T":"301","2":"Evgeny","3":"Lia! Thank goodness... I'm sorry. I got here too late."},{"T":"301","3":"Daddy picked me up and carried me out of the room."},{"T":"301","2":"Evgeny","3":"Let's get out of here first!"},{"T":"301","3":"After running for some time, we arrived at an abandoned factory. The stench and heat of the scorching flames were finally behind us."},{"T":"301","3":"The abandoned factory was full of people who escaped from the settlement. Their faces were covered with blood and despair, while others suffered severe burns during their escape and laid on the ground groaning in pain."},{"T":"301","3":"Seeing us, everyone fell silent. The look in their eyes was filled with something I couldn't understand."},{"T":"301","3":"I didn't realize until much later, that this was\u2014hatred."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"If the flames keep burning like this, I'm afraid the power station will..."},{"T":"301","3":"I don't know who said this, the factory fell back into dead silence."},{"T":"301","3":"That's the area's last centralized power station still in operation. If it's destroyed, the people of Soltvara will be left without a shelter."},{"T":"301","2":"Evgeny","3":"There's no cause for alarm. As long as the outer fire door remains closed, the fire extinguisher system will activate before the fire reaches the core..."},{"T":"301","2":"Ivan","3":"Oh, no... The main door is open!"},{"T":"301","2":"Evgeny","3":"What?! What happened?!"},{"T":"301","3":"Aware of his mistake, Ivan trembled and glanced at Yakov."},{"T":"301","2":"Ivan","3":"It-it was all Yakov's idea. He said to hide..."},{"T":"301","2":"Yakov","3":"Shut up! Now's not the time for that nonsense!"},{"T":"301","2":"Evgeny","3":"...I'm going to go to the power station and close the fire door."},{"T":"301","2":"Evgeny","3":"I'll be right back. Wait for me here."},{"T":"301","3":"Dad reached out and patted my head, then rushed out of the factory without looking back and ran towards the power station."},{"T":"301","2":"Yakov","3":"Ivan! Let's go, too!"},{"T":"301","3":"Yakov grabbed Ivan, who was shaking for some reason, and ran to catch up."},{"T":"301","3":"Soon after, we heard an explosion in the distance."},{"T":"301","3":"Daddy never returned after that."}]
