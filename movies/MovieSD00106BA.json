If someone goes up and rings it, I bet everyone within a ten-kilometer radius could hear it."},{"T":"301","2":"Lee","3":"It's also the best place to light fireworks.

I'm already at my limits..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lucia","3":"...Yes, that's why I'm worried. We haven't received any news on the transmitter yet.
