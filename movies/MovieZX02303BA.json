Now, it also means a difficult dilemma to overcome."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"As everyone knows, the situation on Earth is taking a turn for the worst."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"The high Punishing concentration has caused varying degrees of evolution in Hetero-Creatures across the different regions."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"They have learned to attack in groups. If they are injured, they quickly retreat and regroup in the Red Tide."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Those winged Hetero-Creatures have increased their flight speed and altitude, allowing them to attack transport crafts."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"However, our forces stranded on the surface have been unable to stop the twins from advancing. For now, they can only withdraw."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"The CPF has been destroyed, the greenhouse collapsed, and the blood of the dead has turned into the Red Tide, breeding new enemies."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"We have made great sacrifices to resolve this disaster with little to show for it."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"If this continues, everything that has been restored on the surface will be in vain."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"We need something that can turn the tide in our fight against the Punishing Virus."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Preliminary research on the Omega File \u3010kuroname\u3011 obtained from Atlantis is beginning to show progress."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"The 'Omega Prototype' produced by the Science Council has been proved to be capable of absorbing the Punishing Virus."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"However, it is unable to change the overall environment at its current stage. I propose that we focus all of Babylonia's resources and research into this program."},{"T":"301","3":"Upon announcing the topic for this meeting, Hassen opens the floor for discussion, but no one in the dark room voices their opinion."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"We need to put aside our differences and focus our efforts on solving this crisis immediately."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman A","3":"Is this really a wise use of our resources?"},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman A","3":"Babylonia can be completely self-sufficient so long as we control our consumption and cut supplies for troops on the surface."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"That may be the case, but is it sustainable?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Our current crisis isn't just the high Punishing concentration on the surface, but also Ascendants infiltrating Gestalt and the Hetero-Creatures to obtain air superiority."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Not to mention the emergence of the twins. What makes you think they won't continue to evolve?"},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman C","3":"We should at least come up with a concrete method for solving this crisis before we discuss putting all of our eggs in one basket."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"We've already devised a method."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"However, this method requires assistance from 'Project Winter' to achieve the maximum effect."},{"T":"301","3":"Uttering these two words causes whispers to echo throughout the dimly-lit council."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman E","3":"According to my knowledge, the Science Council has also dabbled in 'Project Winter'."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"However, those conservatives have only been committed to enhancing the stability of specialized frames. They haven't expanded their efforts into controlling the Punishing Virus."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman H","3":"Controlling the Punishing Virus...?"},{"T":"301","3":"The councilman looks at President Hassen sitting silently in front of him."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman H","3":"I'm sure you are aware that based on the current progress of 'Project Winter', the specialized frames designed with the 'latest' data have serious defects."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman H","3":"They're similar to an Ascendant frame by actively gathering the Punishing Virus within the frame and the user's M.I.N.D."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman H","3":"However, since the user isn't an Ascendant, they can't resist the Punishing Virus nor can they control the frame."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman H","3":"Anyone who switched to the 'new' specialized frame was unable to persist in actual combat. They couldn't even last twenty minutes on the surface before succumbing to corruption."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman H","3":"Even if we can somehow delay corruption, there will still be serious damage to their M.I.N.D."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman H","3":"Commandants sacrificed their lives to stabilize their M.I.N.D.s as a result of Mind Beacon pollution."},{"T":"301","3":"Some of the councilmen who had already receded into the shadows show no intent on hiding their position. As a result, he takes the initiative to express their position and voice their concerns."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Even if the Punishing Virus cannot be controlled for now, we can resolve issues with corruption by using the 'Omega Prototype'."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"As for M.I.N.D. corruption, leave that to the CTO."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"During the battle with Alpha and Huaxu..."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Huaxu assumed direct control over Commandant \u3010kuroname\u3011 of Gray Raven, forcibly connecting the commandant with nearby Corrupted."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"I don't need to reiterate the effects on most commandants when they link with Corrupted, but the symptoms of \u3010kuroname\u3011 weren't as serious."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"The three other Constructs of Gray Raven were able to maintain a secure link with \u3010kuroname\u3011 despite the corruption."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Lucia, Liv, Lee, and Chrome who has upgraded to his specialized frame. They've all achieved a level of M.I.N.D. stability capable of handling specialized frames."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"However, due to the instability of this new specialized frame, Constructs that have already been affected by their specialized frame are not fit for this dangerous mission."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"So... That just leaves Lee and Liv."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman H","3":"But \u3010kuroname\u3011 has declined to participate in 'Project Winter'."},{"T":"301","2":"Hilda","3":"That depends on the content of the project."},{"T":"301","2":"Hilda","3":"\u3010kuroname\u3011 and Gray Raven defeated the Polyphage and retrieved the files from Atlantis. Heroes who've garnered such attention shouldn't be used as test subjects."},{"T":"301","3":"Hilda deliberately mentions the word 'heroes' to remind those hiding in the shadows that, even if Earth is fraught with disaster, they can't continue to operate in secret."},{"T":"301","2":"Hilda","3":"The Control Court will supervise this collaboration to ensure the personal safety of \u3010kuroname\u3011, who will not participate in any research other than that which pertains to linking with the new specialized frames."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman J","3":"Gray Raven is still performing missions on the surface while \u3010kuroname\u3011 is in a coma."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman J","3":"Based on the current situation, transport crafts are unable to safely reach the surface, let alone escort Gray Raven back to Babylonia."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"This is what we will discuss next."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"There is an underground base that belongs to Kurono in City 047 where a large number of resources, transport crafts, and a spaceship are stored."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"If permissible, we can retrieve \u3010kuroname\u3011 and the two other Constructs from Gray Raven."},{"T":"301","3":"Whispers begin to circulate among the Parliament."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman H","3":"Have you tested the 'Omega Prototype' yet?"},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"We've successfully run simulations, but we haven't deployed it on the surface yet."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman J","3":"If we can obtain test results regarding its effectiveness against the twins, both sides should be in more equal standing."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Correct. However, we must take it one step at a time."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Given the sacrifice required for a round-trip journey to the surface, they can't be expected to pay with their lives for a test that doesn't yield results."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman H","3":"Once they return to Babylonia, what will you do if \u3010kuroname\u3011 doesn't begin to improve?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"We will wait until \u3010kuroname\u3011 shows signs of improvement before proceeding. If the commandant doesn't regain consciousness, we will think of another plan."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"If there is any hope of averting this disaster, we will change our plans accordingly."},{"T":"301","3":"The council looks at Hilda, but she remains silent and acquiesces to the other result implied by Nikola's phrasing."},{"T":"301","3":"This desolate world no longer leaves any room for tenderness."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman V","3":"We're going to wait until \u3010kuroname\u3011 shows signs of improvement before conducting the experiment?"},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"The situation on Earth is taking a turn for the worst."},{"T":"301","3":"President Hassen reiterates his opening statement."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"If you want to leave researchers time to start their work, this situation demands an immediate course of action."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman V","3":"Even if we manage to mitigate corruption, without a Mind Beacon that can withstand pollution, specialized frames will be difficult to maintain."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Correct. Current data predicts that, if we cannot resolve issues with M.I.N.D. stability, the subject will die within three hours of participating in actual combat."},{"T":"301","3":"Hearing such a minuscule amount of time, everyone's whispers turn to an outcry. However, a council member hiding in the shadows gives a pleasant look of surprise."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman V","3":"Can't believe they lasted three hours without a commandant to maintain stability..."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman H","3":"Is that it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman V","3":"What do you mean, 'is that it?' Last time when we used Lu... Ahem, the specialized frame developed with the new data couldn't even pass the corruption test."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman V","3":"Even though 'they' had 'acquired' data from Glory, then implemented numerous barriers and restrictions..."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman V","3":"But without a commandant that can resist pollution from Mind Beacons, or someone able to maintain M.I.N.D. stability like Chrome, it was just a useless shell."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman V","3":"Even for someone to last just one minute as a human bomb proved to be a disaster."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman V","3":"This is just the first deployment, yet they've already managed to last 3 hours in the simulation. Imagine what we can achieve with such a project in the future with the combined effort of all departments."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman V","3":"I can't wait to see her smile at the results."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman V","3":"The underground base in City 047 is a major asset and property. But the higher-ups shouldn't refuse such a rare invitation from the Parliament."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman H","3":"Hmph... Even now, they won't put down their hypocritical masks. What's wrong with making sacrifices for the sake of science?"},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman J","3":"But only 3 hours... Isn't this experiment a little inhumane?"},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman B","3":"To think you know what 'inhumane' even means... Have you finished cleaning up the aftermath of all those deaths? Or are you being sarcastic?"},{"T":"301","3":"The centrist councilman retorts sarcastically, unable to remain silent any longer."},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"I will arrange for remunerations. Being concerned with personal sacrifices would be an insult to everyone who is still struggling, as well as the soldiers and civilians who died in the disaster."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman J","3":"Is there a specific plan to integrate the 'Omega Prototype' with specialized frames??"},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Yes, but it is currently top-secret."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman J","3":"Then how can you verify the efficacy of such a plan?"},{"T":"301","2":"Nikola","3":"Each party must first negotiate its conditions before verification can be made by both parties."},{"T":"301","2":"Councilman H","3":"Can the Science Council guarantee results from this collaborative effort?"},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"This is just our preliminary course of action. I still haven't received the agent data and we still need to conduct more tests before making any conclusions."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"If we want to improve our current predicament, we have only one choice\u2014cooperation."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"In any case, this is the beginning of hope."},{"T":"301","3":"...But it is only just the beginning."}]
