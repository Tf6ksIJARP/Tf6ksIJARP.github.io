[{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"\u3010kuroname\u3011, I know you just came back from your previous mission, but you've been assigned on another mission."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"It's the ARU. They need support."},{"T":"302","2":"Is it the bionics again...","4":"Is Amberia back again..."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Yes. Everything appears to be normal, but our recent observations have picked up an abnormal signal."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"We can confirm that Amberia has been stopped, but our recent observations have picked up an abnormal signal."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"The Forest Guards have now joined forces with Babylonia, and their relationship with the ARU has stabilized. So we should resolve any anomalies as soon as possible so as to not stir up tension."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"The ARU will fill you in on the specifics. We'll be sending another task force with you. Move out when you're ready."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"In addition, don't forget the remote access link. You always have it on you, correct?"},{"T":"302","2":"Understood."},{"T":"301","3":"The transport craft has landed outside the ARU base. Babylonia Constructs are awaiting you outside, among which you see a familiar face."},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"Hey! Boss, you finally made it! I've been waiting for you!"},{"T":"302","2":"You feeling okay?","4":"Oh, you're here as well?"},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"Don't worry. I'm feeling fine now."},{"T":"301","3":"Simon scratches his head dejectedly as if remembering the last time he vomited and collapsed in the polar region."},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"It's okay, I got what I asked for."},{"T":"301","3":"Simon revealed a faint look of agony."},{"T":"301","3":"Unlike their last meeting, he isn't accompanied by a blonde Construct. Needless to say, his reason for coming was obvious."},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"If only I paid more attention to her... No, even if I did, I wouldn't be able to..."},{"T":"301","3":"Simon shook his head as if trying to rid himself of distractions."},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"Come on, Staessen is waiting for us."},{"T":"301","3":"Upon entering the base, you see Staessen looking at a map with his eyebrows furrowed. Noticing you approach, he raises his head and nods to you."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"You're here... Sorry, there's no welcome party at time like this. Let's cut to the chase."},{"T":"301","3":"He turns on the projector terminal and begins explaining as he points at the connected symbols."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"We found an abnormal signal while we were monitoring the bionics' behavior this month."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"We regarded it as insignificant at first, but this sentient being has been constantly learning and becoming more intelligent with each day."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"We notified Babylonia and, after analyzing bionic minds, we found a sentient bionic signal identified as Amberia in their transmissions."},{"T":"302","2":"Amberia?!","4":"Is Amberia still..."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"Obviously, it isn't the real Amberia."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"It's a pseudo-consciousness integrated and reconstructed out of data fragments that she left in the bionic transmission... It's closer to a bionic or AI than it is to a Construct."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"The bionics that roam the polar region are sub-systems of Amberia, but even though they are no longer integrated with her, Amberia's fragmented data still remains deeply rooted in them."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"Various signs show that some bionics are spontaneously collecting data fragments in the transmission in an attempt to reconstruct Amberia."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"They want to create a new 'Amberia'."},{"T":"301","2":"Liv","3":"A human bionic created by bionics..."},{"T":"301","3":"Liv subconsciously puts her hand on her heart and whispers to herself in thought. Staessen glances at Liv, then continues."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"As a result, no one knows what this new 'Amberia' is capable of or how it well affect the bionics."},{"T":"301","3":"Will she order the remaining bionics to attack the ARU and the surrounding areas? But most importantly, there is no code to control her."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"A considerable number of bionics have connected with Amberia as a new host, which has intensified their desire to attack."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"You need to connect to the bionics' Virtual M.I.N.D. in order to annihilate the remaining data fragments of Amberia and find her location. You must eliminate her before she completely integrates her consciousness."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"In layman's terms, enter Amberia's fragment dream and destroy her."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"It's more efficient to remove the problem at its source rather than destroy the bionics one-by-one. Got it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"I can't maintain M.I.N.D. stability for Constructs that are in deep dive. So, I'll need your help,\u3010kuroname\u3011."},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"That'll be a cakewalk for you, right, Boss?"},{"T":"302","2":"...That's a lot of Constructs.","4":"Am I the only commandant?"},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"I don't need you to connect to every Construct. Just command the Gray Ravens."},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"The Gray Ravens will act as a scout team to explore the bionics' Virtual M.I.N.D. to determine the location of the Amberia."},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"According to President Hassan, you are the only commandant who has a small remote link device and the corresponding rights to use it."},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"The situation is getting dire. The bionics' Virtual M.I.N.D. network only serves as an access point for Constructs. So, you'll need to use the remote link device to access it and lead the team."},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"I heard remote memory links are used specifically to explore dead zones... But our knowledge on virtual M.I.N.D.s are limited, so we need you present. That's why President Hassen made the decision to use the mind link."},{"T":"302","2":"What about you?"},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"Bionics are causing havoc everywhere. There aren't that many right now, but they're growing. My mission is to destroy all of the malfunctioning ones with the Forest Guards, so we can prevent them from attacking the base."},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"Babylonia also supplied us with a special M.I.N.D. stabilizer, which must be given to Constructs before initiating a deep dive. But if the stabilizers don't do their job... You'll need to take the lead."},{"T":"301","3":"At that moment, you receive a transmission on your comms."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Done with the explanations? Now that you're up to speed, I won't have to waste my breath."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"\u3010kuroname\u3011, I'll be analyzing the bionics' Virtual M.I.N.D. network while you explore. I'll try to land you near the coordinates where the abnormal signals came from."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"We'll need your combat data to locate Amberia's consciousness. I'll notify you once we find it."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"That's it. The access port has been relayed to Liv, and I'll provide you with technical support. You'll be in charge, \u3010kuroname\u3011."},{"T":"302","2":"Why me?"},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Because we still need to join forces with the ARU and the Forest Guards.
