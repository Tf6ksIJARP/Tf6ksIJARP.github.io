[{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"Where is this...?"},{"T":"301","3":"When everything finally calmed down, Bianca saw a wetland."},{"T":"301","3":"As far as she could see, there was only greenery and mud. Fallen leaves and new buds scattered on the swamp. A few insect sounds could be heard every now and then."},{"T":"301","3":"A grassland not far away was covered in white."},{"T":"301","2":"Crane","3":"Whoop\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"It was cranes, tens of live cranes gathering over the swamp."},{"T":"301","2":"Crane","3":"Whoop\u2014"},{"T":"301","2":"Crane","3":"Whoop\u2014whoop\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"Bianca heard a few cries from the sedge. Unlike the audio file, they sounded more ear-piercing, but quickly weakened."},{"T":"301","3":"Even without necessary knowledge, Bianca could sense exhaustion, restlessness and discomfort in their sounds. She knew that in the time of war, making such sounds would only wear them down sooner, and eventually lead to extinction as humans no longer had the luxury to provide necessary care."},{"T":"301","2":"Crane","3":"Whoop\u2014whoop\u2014"},{"T":"301","3":"Suddenly, one of the cranes made another clear whoop, not as sharp but louder than any others."},{"T":"301","3":"The sound had a mechanical texture."},{"T":"301","3":"Bianca saw a pair of raising wings, giving a silver shine under the sun."},{"T":"301","3":"It was a bionic machine. Its mechanical voice overwhelmed all the other cries."},{"T":"301","3":"The voice gradually soothed and ceased, which reminded Bianca of the lullaby that she heard in Babylonia. The mechanical crane then pulled one leg back, burying its head in its wings."},{"T":"301","3":"The 'lullaby' was only met by more noisy screaming in the beginning. The few loudest cranes seemed to be upset and gathered near the mechanical crane, knocking it with their long bills."},{"T":"301","3":"But as it continues, a couple of cranes begin to mimic the mechanoid's pose, awkwardly curling up their legs and resting their heads on the body. It is the most suitable position for them to rest."},{"T":"301","3":"Soon, more cranes began to follow, until Bianca saw a group of resting cranes, a common sight in the database."},{"T":"301","3":"The restless cranes are comforted by the mechanical crane's voice."},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"...The CTO mentioned Toniris was based on a bionic machine in the Golden Age."},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"Is this a recording of you and your friends?"},{"T":"301","3":"During the Golden Age, the earth was overdeveloped and animals could only be kept in nature reserves."},{"T":"301","3":"Humans 'blessed' them with stable environments and food supplies, which made them forget their nature over time."},{"T":"301","3":"Without such blessings, the animals were extremely fragile in the wilderness during the Post-Pandemic Age as they lost all the instincts."},{"T":"301","3":"\u2014But they survived."},{"T":"301","3":"They managed to survive till today. Until recently, Bianca heard rumors about the sighting of cranes on the earth."},{"T":"301","3":"A group of bionic machines kept them alive."},{"T":"301","3":"They were originally allocated in the natural reserve with the duty to maintain the environment and monitor the health of live animals."},{"T":"301","3":"When animals were left in the wild to survive, these bionic animals became their protectors."},{"T":"301","3":"They taught the cranes how to open their wings, as well as how to find the air holes left by shellfish in the riverbed when taking a walk."},{"T":"301","3":"Migration, foraging, avoiding enemies... The bionic machines slowly awakened the animals' forgotten instincts, teaching them how to survive on their natural perception."},{"T":"301","3":"They were different from their peers right from the beginning. When humans stopped giving them orders, they still continued the seemingly meaningless guide duty."},{"T":"301","3":"When all beliefs were long gone, what could her prayers possibly do?"},{"T":"301","3":"But even if it made no sense, the action itself still became a symbol. A symbol that could make changes happen."},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"I see... You're just like me. They didn't understand you. They thought you were different. But you were still guiding them in your own way."},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"You worked until the very last moment. When you heard the other cranes, you thought you were back..."},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"You've done a lot, Toniris..."},{"T":"301","3":"The bionic crane raised its head as if it had heard Bianca from afar. It made a gentle tweet and went back to rest."},{"T":"301","3":"Next, the steel leg supporting its body collapsed, and it broke into many pieces. Bianca saw the rust on its body even from a distance."},{"T":"301","3":"The holographic scene reverted to data streams. Gone were the grass, the cranes, and the blue sky."},{"T":"301","3":"Only Toniris was left there, standing at where the bionic crane fell."},{"T":"301","3":"Bianca gently touched its body."},{"T":"301","3":"She does not send a connection request, only stroking along its body like patting a nestling."},{"T":"301","2":"Comms","3":"Miss Bianca... Can you hear me..."},{"T":"301","3":"Bianca was alerted after hearing the voice in the comms channel."},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"What is it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Comms","3":"Lots of Corrupted are approaching your location!"},{"T":"301","2":"Comms","3":"I have contacted other squads... But there is still a massive amount of signals heading your way!"},{"T":"301","2":"Comms","3":"It is impossible for one Construct to face them."},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Comms","3":"S-sorry. I should have been more proactive and worked with you. You could have escaped..."},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"That's okay."},{"T":"301","2":"Comms","3":"No, it's not!"},{"T":"301","2":"Comms","3":"Miss Bianca, you are different from other Purifying Force members. I know this sounds very abrupt..."},{"T":"301","2":"Comms","3":"But I don't want you to die."},{"T":"301","2":"Comms","3":"There are so many jerks out there that deserve death. Why? Why do you have to face this? You are so kind and resilient..."},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"..."},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"Is that what you are hoping for?"},{"T":"301","2":"Comms","3":"Huh?"},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"I'm just being thorough. You said one Construct couldn't face them alone, right?"},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"But it's not just a Construct here."},{"T":"301","2":"Comms","3":"Whaaat?"},{"T":"301","3":"Numerous Corrupted swarm across the horizon. They soon discover Bianca with her human-like consciousness, and rush directly toward her."},{"T":"301","3":"Bianca does not move. Instead, she pulls her bow and starts attacking the Corrupted."},{"T":"301","3":"Toniris opened her wings elegantly, hovering in mid-air and crying out. For one split second, Bianca thought the church was struck by thunder."},{"T":"301","3":"Maybe her 'Veritas' also formed part of the roaring thunder."},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"Now I understand why you didn't want other Constructs to connect to you."},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"Individuals who are always rejected will tend to alienate themselves in return. They get tired of explaining themselves, and refrain from unnecessary contact or conversations..."},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"You were one such individual among the cranes. None of your kin could understand you. That's why I know exactly what you are thinking."},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"Because I'm no different..."},{"T":"301","3":"Bianca closed her eyes and recalled the looks on other Constructs when she wanted to pay her tribute in the funeral, and the fear in the voice of the coordinator over the line earlier."},{"T":"301","3":"She also remembered that formal, pretentious 'professional' she had to fake."},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"...But even though our actions were not understood, we still managed to protect the 'present' that we wanted to cherish."},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"You have done a lot in the 'past.' Would you like to join me to protect the 'future' of our friends?"},{"T":"301","3":"Bianca calls Toniris's name. Her call is not loud, but she stops Toniris's cry."},{"T":"301","2":"Toniris","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"Toniris' head slowly turned to Bianca and stopped for a few seconds, as if it was staring at her through those tiny eyes."},{"T":"301","3":"Bianca rests her hand on the bottom of Toniris' neck. She quietly looks it in the eyes, and initiates the connection once again."},{"T":"301","3":"This time, she does not create a direct connection, but many mini-handshake requests, trying to stimulate a reaction."},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"'Give me your plume, and we shall walk together.'"},{"T":"301","3":"Bianca whispered in a prayer tone, calling for another being in the world that had the patience to listen to her."},{"T":"301","3":"Soon, she felt a slight shock in her palm."},{"T":"301","3":"Along with energy injected from the wings."},{"T":"301","3":"It felt massive but calm, like a thunder slowly building up."},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"...Thank you."},{"T":"301","3":"She let her hands slide down the wings, then picked up her familiar weapon."},{"T":"301","3":"'When God stands, he creates a field of peace. Holy light shines upon, cleansing all his enemies.'"},{"T":"301","3":"Now a Construct and a mechanoid had such holy light in their hands."},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"Charging complete."},{"T":"301","3":"The long bow bent to her hand, lightning gathering in front. One could easily mistake it for holy light in her hand."},{"T":"301","3":"She never felt her arrow so light."},{"T":"301","3":"The Combat Unit Booster's connection makes the lightning bolt as light as a wooden arrow. The enormous energy can be triggered at any time."},{"T":"301","3":"The relentless Corrupted storm through the church's broken door, facing Bianca."},{"T":"301","2":"Bianca","3":"In the name of the Lord... We shall bring you eternal peace."},{"T":"301","3":"She inhales a deep breath and releases her finger. Toniris calls nearby."},{"T":"301","3":"The lightning bolt launched from her bow, bringing destruction to their enemies."}]
