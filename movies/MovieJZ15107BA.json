You're not allowed to refuse, though."},{"T":"301","3":"Camu does not feel particularly aggressive anymore. He might have been tranquilized."},{"T":"301","3":"He does not even react to the word 'Kurono', though he does feel a bit surprised about the Construct part."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Why are you doing this to me?"},{"T":"301","2":"Doctor","3":"Because everyone else besides you died from the virus.
