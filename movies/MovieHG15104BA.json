[{"T":"301","3":"3:35 p.m., Command Central Office, Council Building"},{"T":"302","2":"(Knock on door)"},{"T":"301","2":"??","3":"Come in."},{"T":"301","3":"You enter the office to see Hassen flipping through files at his desk."},{"T":"301","3":"...You notice Asimov's sloppy handwriting on some of the papers. Those must be the records from your previous failed simulation."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Ah. Good afternoon, Gray Raven Commandant. Have you had a good rest these few days?"},{"T":"302","2":"Pretty good.","4":"Not good at all."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"You young people sure are energetic."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"You gotta be confident in yourself, young one! I trust that you'll be able to take on other jobs soon, right?"},{"T":"302","2":"...Yeah."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"I'd like to talk to you about your experience in simulated missions with Camu via remote connection and what you think about it."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"I'll get straight to the point. The Council had a meeting over the data collected in your previous simulation."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"I have two things I'd like to discuss."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"First, the previous few simulated missions were indeed tougher\u2014or, if I should say, they targeted Camu's weak spots especially. I'm sure you've noticed."},{"T":"302","2":"Yeah. You wanted to find out his limits."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"It might seem cruel of us, but if we can't pinpoint and deal with the weak points during training, things would only get worse in a real battle."},{"T":"302","2":"I understand.","4":"You're being too hard on him."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"We've adjusted the battle plans accordingly."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"We want to make sure that Camu deserves to be on the team despite all the risks he brings."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"That's why we want to reconfirm this."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Commandant \u3010kuroname\u3011, are you still willing to continue working with Camu in combat via remote M.I.N.D. connection?"},{"T":"302","2":"He's an excellent fighter..."},{"T":"302","2":"And trustworthy."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"...Is that your answer?"},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"I see."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Before you leave, I have one more thing to say."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"I made the right choice assigning him to you, \u3010kuroname\u3011."},{"T":"302","2":"I hope so."},{"T":"301","2":"Hassen","3":"Perhaps you'd like to hear HIS choice."},{"T":"302","2":"His choice?"},{"T":"301","3":"Hassen simply smiles in his usual benevolent way and gestures at you to close the door when you leave."},{"T":"301","3":"The corridor is empty. If your memory serves you, Camu should be in the office on the opposite side."},{"T":"302","2":"(Wait for him)","4":"(Leave)"},{"T":"301","3":"You have just decided to wait when the office door opens."},{"T":"301","3":"You are about to leave when the office door opens."},{"T":"301","3":"Camu comes striding out. The mild annoyance on his face is replaced by a constrained expression."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"What did they say to you?"},{"T":"302","2":"They asked where you went last night.","4":"They asked if I wanted to keep working with you."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"O-Oh?"},{"T":"301","3":"Camu stares at you in suspicion."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"And what did you tell them?"},{"T":"302","2":"I said you were with me."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"?"},{"T":"302","2":"Heh, just kidding."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"That's what I thought."},{"T":"301","3":"Camu squints. Looks like he has already guessed the topic of your meeting."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Hey. What did you tell them?"},{"T":"302","2":"I declined, of course.","4":"I agreed, of course."},{"T":"301","3":"Camu freezes, as if not expecting such a direct answer. It's rare to see him so baffled."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"...So you gave up on me, huh."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Revolting. And you were spouting all those pretty words yesterday..."},{"T":"302","2":"I was kidding."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Do you really think I\u2014uh, what?"},{"T":"302","2":"I agreed."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"...Hey! Are you ******* trying to die? Playing with me like that?"},{"T":"301","3":"Camu looks genuinely enraged."},{"T":"302","2":"My bad, my bad.","4":"I was just joking."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"You won't find anyone better than me anyway."},{"T":"302","2":"What did you choose, then?"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Is that important?"},{"T":"302","2":"Of course.","4":"Just interested in your answer."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Enough. I'm not falling for that again!"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"I already agreed to cooperate from the time being. I'd rather you hone your skills a bit instead of acting like my therapist."},{"T":"302","2":"Can we train together again?","4":"Can we eat together again?"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Of course. I want to shut that creepy nerd up with an impressive performance."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"Of course. You owe me."},{"T":"302","2":"When did I ever owe you\u2014forget it."},{"T":"302","2":"So I'll see you tomorrow in the training room, huh?"},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"You'd better not be late. I hate waiting."},{"T":"302","2":"You're the one who's always late..."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"I'm not the one asking you to come, though."},{"T":"302","2":"I'll be on time."},{"T":"301","2":"Camu","3":"You'd better be."}]
