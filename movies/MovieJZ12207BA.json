[{"T":"301","3":"The Corrupted with dark wings slowly descends upon the hill. Its grotesque appearance sends shivers down Lloyd's and Yanna's spines."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Do you seriously think you can run away with that wounded Construct?"},{"T":"301","3":"Gabriel looks unrushed, not even looking away from the book in its hand."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"Yanna... Move behind me..."},{"T":"301","3":"The female Construct's leg is wounded. Lloyd shields her behind himself and taunts Gabriel with a relaxed voice."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"It's nice to be flying. Speaking of injuries, you are not much different."},{"T":"301","3":"Gabriel finally closes the book and looks down at its own chest. The oil leak marks on its cloak are clearly visible."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"You are indeed a commendable warrior. Not many Constructs can hurt me like this even if they put their lives on the line. Very good, but your effort is meaningless..."},{"T":"301","3":"Gabriel gently tears its cloak apart, revealing the wound that is already healed under the effect of the Punishing Virus."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"...What a monster."},{"T":"301","3":"Lloyd squeezes out a smile. He has never heard of a Corrupted with such great power, let alone its incredible intelligence."},{"T":"301","2":"Yanna","3":"Lloyd... I can still fight..."},{"T":"301","3":"Yanna pulls her katana out, but she can barely stand."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"Don't worry. It's just bluffing... and it's alone. I can handle this."},{"T":"301","3":"Lloyd makes a hand gesture behind his back, hinting Yanna to run to the east once he gives her the signal."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"Your mission is to go back to Babylonia and report this new enemy to the HQ... Understood?"},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"What a pity... Instead of embracing the Punishing Virus, humans would rather run."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"Do you want me to befriend the virus that destroyed the world? Sorry, but my dream is to become a hero. I have no plan to be a monster like you!"},{"T":"301","3":"Lloyd suddenly dashes forward, travelling more than ten meters within an instant. The tip of his banner spear has almost reached Gabriel's chest."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Not bad. But your 'surprise factor' is meaningless against machines."},{"T":"301","3":"The spear tip collides with Gabriel's claws, striking fierce sparks. But Gabriel's strength is clearly superior."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"Yanna!"},{"T":"301","3":"Yanna grits her teeth and runs toward the east. She will be safe as long as she can catch up with the main force..."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"...But it's too late."},{"T":"301","3":"Gabriel suddenly pushes Lloyd away, then hurls its sharp staff-like blade with its left hand toward Yanna, who can only close her eyes."},{"T":"301","3":"But when she opens her eyes again, she realizes she is still alive. Lloyd managed to throw his banner spear to deflect the staff."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"I am truly shocked... by your reflex, decision, accuracy... and stupidity."},{"T":"301","3":"Gabriel exaggeratedly extends his arms, pulling the claws from Lloyd's right shoulder. Red vital fluid pours out from his mouth."},{"T":"301","3":"Still, he quickly jumps back at a speed that does not match his injuries and stands in front of Yanna."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Is this what so-called 'heroes' do? Giving up your weapon and getting badly wounded, just to save a Construct that can't be of any use?"},{"T":"301","3":"Gabriel's taunt makes Lloyd laugh out loud."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"Hah... Don't say that so early. Sometimes 'surprise factor' can still work on machines, don't you think?"},{"T":"301","3":"Gabriel looks back at itself and finds out three of its left wings were destroyed from their root."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"I see. You split the weapon in two. One was used to save that Construct, the other was aiming at my wings."},{"T":"301","3":"Yanna runs over to hold Lloyd as he can barely stand up. She realizes how bad his wound is."},{"T":"301","2":"Yanna","3":"Lloyd! Why..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"Listen, Yanna!"},{"T":"301","3":"Lloyd interrupts her abruptly. He knows there is no time to hesitate."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"That Corrupted can't fly now. If I can pull it off the cliff, it won't be able to catch you even if your legs can't function properly."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"Now stand up and run! I will stop it for you..."},{"T":"301","2":"Yanna","3":"But... you will die."},{"T":"301","3":"Lloyd smiles as he pretends to be relaxed."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"Don't worry... I will leave through recalling after keeping him here for some time. Trust me."},{"T":"301","2":"Yanna","3":"Lloyd... I'm not smart, but I can tell that you are lying. The risk of recalling when facing such a powerful Corrupted cannot be predicted."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"But we don't have..."},{"T":"301","2":"Yanna","3":"No... There's another option."},{"T":"301","3":"Yanna lets go of Lloyd and steps aside. She smiles."},{"T":"301","2":"Yanna","3":"I'll do the recall instead... Then you can safely get out of here without me. I have faith in you!"},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"You can't! Recalling is a..."},{"T":"301","3":"Recalling is a lie. There is no redemption\u2014but Lloyd cannot say it out. This lie is heavier than his and Yanna's lives combined."},{"T":"301","2":"Yanna","3":"Alright then, Lloyd. I will see you on the battlefield."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"No! Don't!"},{"T":"301","3":"Lloyd grabs Yanna's hands, but they have already gone stiff... Her mind is forever lost with the so-called 'recall' mechanism."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Hmm? Did she choose to end her life? But it's too late. You might be able to survive if you could give up on her earlier."},{"T":"301","3":"Lloyd collapses to the ground next to Yanna. Gabriel slowly walks to him and extends its left hand. Dark-red Punishing Virus begins to gather in his palm."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"But with your aptitude, you may become our new comrade. Come, embrace the trial of the Ascension-Network..."},{"T":"301","3":"The deadly red glow intensifies\u2014which also causes Gabriel to ignore the fact that Lloyd has secretly clenched Yanna's blade."},{"T":"301","3":"A silver flash separates Gabriel's left arm from its shoulder."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"I need to change my view on you. Your strength has indeed exceeded my expectation, to the point that..."},{"T":"301","3":"Gabriel looks down at Lloyd and shakes its head. As Lloyd cuts off Gabriel's left arm, his chest is also impaled by its claw."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"It even forces me to kill you."},{"T":"301","3":"Gabriel picks up the top hat with its right hand that is soaked in red vital fluid. It gives a slight bow to Lloyd out of respect."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"Thanks to you, I learned the word 'hero' today. You had great strength of body and mind... Too bad you chose to fight for humans, instead of contributing your power to the Ascension-Network."},{"T":"301","2":"Gabriel","3":"...Humans don't deserve 'heroes.'"},{"T":"301","3":"Gabriel puts the top hat back on its head and turns away. The untimely rain begins to fall quietly, soaking Lloyd's broken body."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"Sorry... Yanna... I couldn't tell you the truth in the end..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"And sorry to you... Commander Nikola... I can't return to Babylonia as a hero once again..."},{"T":"301","3":"Lloyd takes out a notebook from his pocket and holds it tight in his arms, as if it matters more than his life."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"Maybe one day, 'Lloyd' can live in a world that no longer needs heroes or lies..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"What kind of different life will he live, I wonder?"},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"By that time, our stories no longer need to be kept secret. Maybe he will pass them down like a writer in the Golden Age..."},{"T":"301","3":"The rain and wind seem to fade away as Lloyd's hand loses its grip on the notebook."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"Then, our efforts, as well as all those sacrifices and lies... aren't in vain."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"I'm leaving everything to you..."},{"T":"301","2":"Lloyd","3":"The 'Lloyd' of the future."}]
