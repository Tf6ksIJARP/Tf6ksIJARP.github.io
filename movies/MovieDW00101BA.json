[{"T":"301","3":"The decks of the Nighter\u2014a floating stronghold tasked with perimeter and maritime defense\u2014is littered with the dead and dying, consequences of a costly battle against the Ascendant earlier in the day."},{"T":"301","3":"Apart from the Nighter crew, there are also members of the Forsaken and the ACA, who have stayed to bolster the defense."},{"T":"301","3":"Striding past them, Pulao can manage nothing more than nods of appreciation\u2014she had more pressing matters to attend to."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"Be careful! Lash the corners tight. Did they not teach you how to tie knots?"},{"T":"301","3":"Pulao is directing the Nighter crew to move the vast amounts of cargo still on board the ship."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"There is only so much that we can carry. All this precious cargo, supplies that have kept the Voyage afloat for all this time. A tragedy, to be honest......"},{"T":"301","3":"Having lived on board for such a long time, Pulao has conflicted feelings about the Nighter."},{"T":"301","2":"Pulao","3":"They've all scurried ashore and left this mess for me to clean up. The Nighter is so quiet\u2014eh? Perhaps not so quiet after all."},{"T":"301","3":"Next to a haphazard collection of cargo, two bands of people are locked into a standoff. Judging by their outfits, neither belong to the crew."},{"T":"301","2":"Forsaken Soldier","3":"Enough, Akdilek scum! We've had enough of your nonsense!"},{"T":"301","2":"Sophia","3":"It is not nonsensical for the cargo to go to the highest bidder."},{"T":"301","2":"Forsaken Soldier","3":"What you call 'highest bidder', I call 'cutting in line'! The Nighter promised us this cargo. We had a deal!"},{"T":"301","2":"Jamilah","3":"They would sell one of their own if the price was right. An oral contract means nothing to them."},{"T":"301","2":"Forsaken Soldier","3":"Hey!
