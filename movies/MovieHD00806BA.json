What's wrong this time..."},{"T":"301","3":"Constructs technically do not require sleep, but waking up to a mission notification is still very irritating."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"...Oh, this thing. We'll probably sort it out in a week."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"But... what just... fell on my eye masks?"},{"T":"301","3":"Taking off his mask, Wanshi finds two stickers attached to it, one for each eye. The stickers are red, with a golden 'good fortune' written on them, and they look very festive."},{"T":"301","3":"Wanshi shakes his head helplessly."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"...What a nuisance. Hey, Kamui."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"They should be here at this hour.

Capt... let me do another one..."},{"T":"301","3":"Seeing that the footage goes for at least a dozen hours, Wanshi cannot help but tremble."},{"T":"301","3":"He wonders if it was the boring lectures that bored Kamui to sleep, or if the obstinate Kamui had spent all of Chrome's energy."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"...I guess I can skip the goodbyes.

Can I take another set of couplets back?"},{"T":"301","2":"Allen","3":"Sure.
