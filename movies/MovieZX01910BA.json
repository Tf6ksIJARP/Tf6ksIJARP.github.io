Together, she and Wanshi hook up Chrome to the machine."},{"T":"301","2":"Doctor A","3":"I recommend you get him out of here as soon as possible."},{"T":"301","3":"She quietly whispers to Wanshi as they hook up the machine."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Why?"},{"T":"301","2":"Doctor A","3":"He won't get help, if you know what I mean."},{"T":"301","2":"Doctor A","3":"If you ask why, all I can say is that the hospital is running out of supplies."},{"T":"301","2":"Doctor A","3":"I'll be in trouble if I say any more."},{"T":"301","3":"She clears her throat after hooking up the machine."},{"T":"301","2":"Doctor A","3":"I've got work to do. If you think of another way, just leave the filter here. I'll come get it later."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"Thank you."},{"T":"301","3":"She nods, then disappears behind a corner marked Star of Life."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Is this the only way?"},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"We need to replace his dying parts now so that he has a chance to survive and recover."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"But there aren't any available maintenance rooms or suitable parts."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"What about somewhere else? Like A29?"},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"...I thought about that too, but what the hell does it mean?"},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"In puzzle games, this sort of code normally represents a password, location, or a particular spot in a large set of data."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"The captain couldn't have left us a clue about something none of us know about, like a lock. The closest building related to A29 is a shop."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Then that only leaves one possibility."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"The directory?"},{"T":"301","3":"Before they had arrived at this conclusion, they had been pouring over the directory looking for people to call for help. It seems so obvious now."},{"T":"301","3":"After the two reach a consensus, they quickly take out Chrome's terminal."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Column A, number 29... Hey, 28 and 29 are both Asimov."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"...Let's give it a try."},{"T":"301","3":"Wanshi presses the number in the directory."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"However, no one answers their last glimmer of hope."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"As the dial tone continues to ring, a rare bead of sweat appears on Wanshi's forehead."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"...If I can get the replacement parts for his frame, I can try to replace them here."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Want to contact the captain's father? He rarely talks about his family, but I've heard others mention him."},{"T":"301","3":"It's rare to see Kamui this serious. Wanshi looks up for a moment."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"...I've heard some rumors, but did you see the situation just now? They've obviously taken the captain's father into account."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"...I think we should keep trying to reach Asimov."},{"T":"301","3":"Wanshi presses the name in the directory once, twice, three times, four times, five times..."},{"T":"301","3":"Suddenly, there is a prompt to connect with them from the other end."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui & Wanshi","3":"Asimov!!!"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Ahh!!!"},{"T":"301","3":"There is nothing in front of the communication monitor except a young scream."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"S-s-sorry. I shouldn't have connected Mr. Asimov's comm link without his permission, but it kept ringing."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Who's there? Forget it. Doesn't matter. Do you know where he is?"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"W-what? It DOES matter! My name's Rosa. I came to ask Mr. Asimov a few things..."},{"T":"301","3":"Judging from her childish voice and being unable to reach the camera, the girl had to be six or seven years old at most."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosa","3":"He's not here. I think he's hiding so he can continue his research."},{"T":"301","2":"Wanshi","3":"We've got an emergency. Where is he exactly?"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosa","3":"A-an emergency...? Go to Zone B3 of the Science Council. That's where he goes so no one bothers him."},{"T":"301","3":"B3 is the new research building of the Science Council, which is fairly close to the Star of Life."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Let's go."},{"T":"301","3":"A ray of hope shines on their beleaguered faces. Kamui picks up Chrome again and rushes to the shuttle outside."},{"T":"301","3":"The shuttle quickly turns into Zone B3. There is a young girl standing in front of the stairs of the building."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosa","3":"Hi... I'm Rosa. You said it was an emergency, so I followed you here to see if I can help... Mr. Asimov should be in the sealed lab."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Sealed lab?"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosa","3":"Yeah, Mr. Asimov doesn't like being bothered, so..."},{"T":"301","3":"She explains obediently but begins to get nervous after seeing Kamui's anxious face."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosa","3":"S-s-sorry! Follow me!!"},{"T":"301","3":"Rosa races into the building and up the emergency stairwell at nearly Mach 1, banging on a wall around the corner."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosa","3":"Mr. Asimovvvv...!"},{"T":"301","3":"Rosa's voice trembles with a slight whimper. The crashing of various research equipment comes from the depths of the sealed lab."},{"T":"301","3":"Arriving upstairs, Asimov stares at Wanshi with kindred dark circles of brilliance under his eyes as he is packing up the things he had just knocked over."},{"T":"301","3":"Wanshi wants to ask, 'So, someone CAN scare Asimov, huh?' but he has more pressing issues."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Save our captain, Asimov!"},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"He looks at Chrome, who is gravely injured in Kamui's arms, and his face turns pale."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Come with me."},{"T":"301","3":"Asimov hurries into the sealed lab. Rosa stands there timidly and waves as if choosing not to follow them."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"This might not be the ER, but your timing couldn't be better."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"I've been working to fix the remaining problems with Chrome's frame since this morning. Sorry, I left my terminal in the workshop. People kept disrupting me."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"I just so happened to fix the issue that's been giving me trouble all this time."},{"T":"301","3":"Asimov pushes open the door, takes Chrome from Kamui and places him on the maintenance table."},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Wanshi, give me hand."},{"T":"301","3":"Wanshi nods, then immediately begins attaching various instruments near the table to Chrome."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"What about me?"},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"I still need to confirm some things. Grab my terminal. Rosa may have taken it with her."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Terminal?"},{"T":"301","2":"Asimov","3":"Go."},{"T":"301","2":"Kamui","3":"Roger!"}]
