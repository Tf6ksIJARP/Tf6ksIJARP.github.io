[{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"What's the meaning of this? Why did they mention Amberia's name?!"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Oh. You think I'm playing her like a puppet?"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Are you not?"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"I can only influence her dreams. I can't control her directly."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Then what's the deal with the bionics?!"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"I only said I'd give you a chance, not work with you as an equal. If you want me to uphold my end of the promise, you'd better go harder at it, dear."},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"...You!"},{"T":"301","2":"???","3":"Seems like you really want out, Amberia. Don't you?"},{"T":"301","3":"\u2014\u2014"},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"You people... What are you trying to get outta me..."},{"T":"301","3":"After ensuring the safety of the area, you and Rosetta went over to Captain Staessen according to Rosetta's proposal and asked him about Amberia."},{"T":"301","3":"You had expected some clues or answers, but the result was unexpected."},{"T":"301","3":"Upon hearing Amberia's name, Staessen immediately dismissed the guards with an apprehensive expression on his face. He must know something."},{"T":"301","2":"Atiel","3":"You... You can't possibly know about Amberia, can you?!"},{"T":"301","3":"Atiel could not help but lose her temper over Staessen's inane muttering. She stomps forth and grabs his collar."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"Hey!"},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"Stop, Atiel! He's on our side!"},{"T":"301","2":"Atiel","3":"..."},{"T":"301","3":"Atiel lets go, but gives Staessen a piercing glare."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"So what is it? Is Amberia still alive?"},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"I, I..."},{"T":"302","2":"We need to know everything that's going on.","4":"Do you want to relive that tragedy?"},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"What's the point? It's not like you can do anything about it. This will just be like the previous tides, it'll come to an end soon... Ah..."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"There won't be no 'tragedy.' We easily snuffed out the last tide, and we'll do it again this time... Ah..."},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"So, she really is alive then?"},{"T":"301","3":"Staessen's broken mumblings confirm the suspicions within your heart."},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"Tell me, Captain. Why did you try to cover it up? Where is she now? How can you tolerate this?!"},{"T":"301","3":"Even Diana lets out her anger. The name Amberia is evidently a monument in the heart of the Forest Guard."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"...I wasn't trying to cover it up. No, I never did!"},{"T":"301","2":"Diana","3":"What?"},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"It was the previous captain, and the ones before. THEY did that! Every new captain is ordered to keep it a secret. If I had known this from the beginning, I would never have tried to be one!"},{"T":"301","3":"Like a crumbling tower, Staessen grabs and pulls at his hair, shrieking angrily at you and the others."},{"T":"302","2":"Then, can you tell us the truth?","4":"Why keep it a secret then?"},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"...Ugh, why'd it turn out like this?"},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"I wasn't trying to! But who'd believe me? And you know what happens to traitors!"},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"Not to mention, if I were to tell everyone that Amberia was still alive, the ARU would delve into chaos. If we ran into any trouble during so, we'd all..."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"...Oh, forget it! I don't care anymore! You wanna know the truth, I'll tell you truth! But you better not tell anyone else!"},{"T":"301","3":"The room falls into silence. Staessen begins spitting out everything he knows."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"I don't know exactly HOW, but the ARU used a code to suppress Amberia."},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"A code... So some kind of preset authentication?"},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"Something like that... Anyway, the leaders in control of the code put Amberia into a deep sleep. They then sealed her and the bionics away somewhere in this tundra."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"...First things first though. I don't know where either."},{"T":"301","2":"Atiel","3":"...How can you NOT KNOW? You're not messing with us, are you?"},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"I REALLY DON'T! All I heard from the previous captain was that Amberia's nightmares are what's controlling the tide."},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"The nightmares are disturbing her M.I.N.D., causing the linked bionics to attack people on the surface?"},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"That's what should be the case this time round as well. The bionics also mentioned Amberia, yeah?"},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"When her nightmare ends, she will return to her deep slumber. That will put the bionics to rest."},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"That doesn't seem likely."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"...Why?"},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"Before that, I need to confirm something, Boss. Did you see bionics carrying away energy tanks before our rendezvous?"},{"T":"302","2":"You mean the energy tanks in the base...?","4":"What do you think they're planning?"},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"Yeah, that's what I was in a hurry to confirm just now. Most of the energy in the base were stolen."},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"They must be trying to activate some sort of special machine."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"Wait... You don't mean? They're hauling the energy tanks to Amberia?"},{"T":"301","2":"Simon","3":"Not much else they'd need so many energy tanks for, I'm afraid... Looks like sleeping beauty is about to wake up."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"No... That can't be. If she awakens, there's no way we can defeat her. She must be trying to get revenge on the ARU..."},{"T":"301","3":"The pace of Staessen's speech quickens, growing more erratic by the second. He tries to scamper for the shipyard, but is blocked off by Rosetta."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"We'll have to fight to see if we win or lose. But for now, we still have a way out... The code... Do you really not have any idea about it?"},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"...You might find something in the research lab. I'm sure you Forest Guards are familiar with it\u2014the lab used to make Constructs."},{"T":"301","2":"Staessen","3":"I don't know what's in there, but you should hurry. If you can find the code, we can put Amberia back to sleep again."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Whether she's back or not, as long as we have the code, we will always have the upper hand, huh..."},{"T":"302","2":"Well then, let's go search for the code.","4":"Do we still have time?"},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"Heh, we think alike."},{"T":"301","2":"Rosetta","3":"No other choice, Commandant. Let's get going."},{"T":"301","2":"Atiel","3":"She's right, Boss. Let's get other Constructs to fortify a defensive line while we look for the code!"}]
